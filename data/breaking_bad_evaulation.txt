Right-o, that should do 'er.	All right, watches off necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets Gold.
Check your pockets one more time, please.	Oh, uh, credit cards.
That's more than the length of the room.	Who's doing the honors? - Me.
Flip that switch, turns it on.	Twist this here.
Who are you looking for? Um, Ted Beneke.	I'm a friend of his.
I tell you, he's been a real champ.	His color's better, and his blood pressure's up.
Ted, I just-- Skyler I haven't said anything to anyone.	I told them it was an accident.
I tripped and fell.	That is all they know.
You can do it.	Take it easy.
Take it easy.	You got it.
White, let's get out of here.	Just one minute.
Untraceable salvage, all of it.	I made sure of that, too.
Glass screen is broken and in pieces.	Bag still sealed.
Check it out.	That's not on the manifest.
All right, so first off, I'm not a marriage counselor.	Nor do I takes sides in this thing.
"Let's involve Walt in this discussion.	" Yeah, that's what I told her.
She said no.	And you didn't argue the point.
She's my client, same as you.	Does this arrangement get a little tricky at times? Absolutely.
Beg, borrow, or steal, I'm your huckleberry.	I go the extra mile.
H-- We're done when I say we're done.	I heard what happened to Ted.
I forgive you.	Check it out, that's not on the manifest.
We're done when I say we're done.	If you have any brains you'll skip town.
I am scared.	Scared? Scared of what? You.
What the hell is that? My Roomba.	I already checked it.
Let me see.	Is it still intact? Yeah.
Hey, hey, now I almost kill you all because	It was just a-- A misunderstanding, that's all.
I - Hey.	I don't know how I could be so stupid.
Go forward where? Ohh.	Stillwell, steady as she goes.
I don't know what you're talking about.	Helmsman, left 180.
I take full responsibil-- Thanks for seeing us.	We're here to talk partnership.
But there's still distribution, support, logistics, that sort of thing.	For instance, we'll need a steady supply of precursor.
Granted, there's a lot of work ahead.	There's a lot of rebuilding.
And, no doubt, our profits will be smaller.	At least at first.
But each of us will receive a larger cut.	Owners, not employees.
Thanks, but no, thanks.	Mike, I know you don't care for me.
Well, sleep on it.	Maybe you'll reconsider.
Came in their own G5, just like Oprah has.	G5, yeah? - Mm-hmm.
An innocent man does not kill	My people and I are here to help.
Through your investigation I pledge Madrigal's full cooperation and transparency.	I confess I have my selfish reasons.
Outstanding police work, Hank.	If only I'd listened.
But I guess the damage was done.	It's not right, them putting this on you.
Somebody's gonna go under the bus.	Ramey's a good man.
He'll do right by you.	Besides, this office practically runs itself.
The APD did find some of Fring's financials.	That just might lead to something.
I had him out to my house.	Fourth of July.
We cooked out in the backyard.	My son shucked the corn.
My daughter cut up potatoes.	Fring brought sea bass.
And he's somebody else completely.	Right in front of me.
Oh, sorry, we don't have chamomile tea.	Then some sort of bergamot, provided it's not Earl Grey.
I like soy milk instead of dairy.	We don't have soy milk or any sort of bergamot.
We have Lipton's.	That's pretty much all we have.
We'll talk like this.	I guess I'm coming to you.
Breathe in, breathe out.	Drink your whatever.
Those 11 men-- and I think you know this, Mike.	Those 11 could sink us, you and me both.
Where are we going with this, Lydia? No specific.	I'm just pointing out facts.
I'd love your input.	You want me to kill every man on that list?
They picked him up last night.	My guys are solid.
I get it.	So we're off that very silly idea? Good.
Drink your hot water.	I gotta go.
Bye, big brother.	Say bye to mom for me.
Mariano can open for me today.	Hey, how about you get up, huh? Come on.
How you holding up? Okay.	You know, they-- they-- They talked to me.
You can't smoke in here, Chow.	Thanks for coming down.
We just have a few questions.	You're currently employed by the Pollos Hermanos chain.
Is that correct? - Yes, I am.	And what do you do there? - Corporate security.
Two million and change we found on deposit for her.	Way more than anybody else.
" I said, "Whoa, whoa.	Hey, partner, slow down there.
Before anyone says it, no more RV's.	I don't know.
The crystal ship did pretty good for us.	The "crystal ship"? - Yeah.
Saul, find us someplace safe from prying eyes.	Security against detection is paramount.
But I don't wanna drive too far.	No more 50-mile treks to some Indian reservation.
Jesse, there is methylamine out there.	I know it.
Yeah, but what if there's not? Because there isn't.	I mean, really.
But, me? I should quit now.	Jesse, too, I suppose, huh? Wow.
I give up, baby.	You're too good.
I need it.	I need my money.
I don't know.	We gotta talk.
Not on the phone.	Can you come to my house? All right.
I figured I'd start with you.	For you, she was gonna pay 30,000.
I'm very sorry about this, Mike.	But I needed the money.
Oh, yes, she ate everything.	She ate her peas, she ate her carrots.
Delores, I'm gonna take a bath.	Put Kira to bed and then go on home.
Mommy's very tired, so let's go to bed.	I won't have to unless you scream.
Two good men died because of you.	Don't shoot me in the
Your daughter won't see you.	Yes, she will.
She'll find me.	She never once sleeps through the night.
Lower your voice.	She has to find me.
She has to know I didn't leave her.	She has to know that! - Keep your voice down.
I don't care what you do.	I'll scream and I'll keep screaming.
You have to promise.	You have to promise me Promise I don't disappear.
Can you still get your hands on methylamine? Methylamine, Lydia.	Can you still get it? Maybe.
My guys are solid.	They're paid to stand up to the heat.
I am scared.	Of what? - You.
Fring had all these secret off shore accounts.	He's not impressed, Gomie.
How you doing today? - Hey, Dan.	I'm looking for something in a Markowski.
That'd be, uh, Dennis Markowski? That's the one.	Oh, and I've got my, uh, paralegal with me today.
Paralegal? Coming up in the world.	You know it.
It wasn't me.	It wasn't a message.
But I'm doing my time like I'm supposed to.	I'm no rat, and you know it.
I knew the risks.	We all did.
Okay? The lab's a hole in the ground.	I just don't see it.
I've got something new.	It's just starting up.
Hanging tight's your business.	Your family's gonna be fine.
You will be made whole.	Now, you got my word.
Who's next? That's your choice.	APD's got Martinez across town.
Up in Sandoval.	The Sandia tribal cops are holding him for the feds.
We don't need a fourth amigo.	Saul, Mike knows the business.
He meant it.	Saul, Mike threatened me.
He threatened Jesse.	He probably threatened someone before breakfast this morning.
Grow a pair.	Let it be noted that I do this under duress.
Let him in, Huell.	Mike, I'm extending you the-- Uh-huh.
Hey, you're okay with that? Yes.	He handles the business, and I handle him.
I'm not gonna mince words.	This is your best bet.
Got machines running, forklifts, people coming and going.	You're gonna stay way under the radar.
More good news.	I've been here when it's up and running.
This place stinks already.	You'll blend right in.
How many employees? Ha.	I knew you'd ask.
Yeah I don't know.	It'll make the tortillas smell like cat piss.
You know, be creative.	Put your heads together.
Anything food-related is gonna have unannounced government inspections.	All I'm asking is that you keep an open mind.
I get it.	Just say no, and we'll go get dinner.
No way we're cooking in here.	No space, nowhere for the smell to go.
Look at that door.	That thing rolls up, and we're open to the world.
Termites, cockroaches, whatever.	Homeowners hire a pest control company.
Truck rolls up, homeowners leave.	The crew tents the house.
They bomb the place with	The house stays like that for days.
No one looks twice at a tented house.	Now, maybe there's a strange smell coming out of it.
Does someone think to investigate? No.	Anyone go inside? Hell, no.
ponytail on the sidewalk-- that's Ira.	He's the owner.
On the roof is Sandor.	The ladder's Fernando, and down below-- that's Todd.
Ira and his guys are good.	I mean, they know how to keep their mouths shut.
And if you buy them, they're gonna stay bought.	You can check into them yourself.
I will, if it comes to that.	So, do we take a vote? Why? We sound great.
Top of the line.	Recessed hardware, foam lining, * walls, three-inch
Little stuff, big stuff We would be all over it.	You know, uh, maybe someday.
Got it? All right.	From time to time, you're gonna see these two.
Now, as far as you're concerned, they are ghosts.	You don't see them.
You don't hear them.	You don't say "good morning.
That will work.	And Joe and his guys can build it, right? Yeah.
You know, they're, uh-- they're up for it.	Joe already bought a TIG welder for the aluminum work.
We were just, uh, wrapping up.	Um, this is my, uh Friend.
He mostly just wants to play his game.	Oh, I know that.
I have two of my own.	A boy and a girl.
Well, I should, uh-- I should go.	I was thinking I could make us all some dinner.
Are you sure you don't wanna-- Yeah.	Won't you stay for a beer at least? Sure.
So you're gonna get them all, right? We'll kill 'em	That's a guarantee.
I just thought you should now.	What's your name? Todd, sir.
And the way she looks at you? - Oh-ho.	You think? Oh, definitely.
Sometimes you just gotta listen to your gut.	I mean, instant family.
What more can you ask, right? Absolutely.	Cut the cards.
But I never told her anything.	I'm not gonna.
I know you do.	Jesse, I can't pretend that this doesn't affect me.
Secrets create barriers between people.	I'm speaking from experience, believe me.
If she loves you, she'll understand.	They're leaving streaks.
It's just-- it's-- it's simple quality control.	So, I've got some good news.
I want you to guess.	Really, I really - Okay.
He's hardly using his cane at all.	And thank you for that, really.
But at this point, every year is precious.	We are-- What are you doing? You don't smoke.
Marie, shut up.	What? I'm sorry.
Did you know she's smoking? Occasionally, maybe.	It's not a regular thing.
It's time to tell me the truth, Walt.	All of it.
He's still in the hospital.	He may never walk again.
Oh, my God.	I-- I didn't-- I didn't know.
But that couldn't explain Skyler's-- Uh Yes.	Yes, it could.
Ouch! That looked nasty.	Hey, you okay? I'm good.
You want to fuck with me?	You little cockroaches.
I think there's some pizza left.	If you're up to it.
Everyone dies in this movie, don't they? Ahh! Okay.	For you and you and me.
You're almost 300,000 short.	You're forgetting about the mules.
They get a flat 20%.	The what? - The drivers.
He didn't need them.	He spent 20 years building his own distribution.
He had 16 refrigerator trucks running his product.	And you know where they are now? Government impound.
Ira's guys get Goodman's cut-- Legacy cost-- $351,000.	That's 117,000 each.
It's what you do.	My guys are keeping their mouths shut.
We make 'em whole.	One hand washes the other.
It sounds like a simple shakedown, simple as that.	We're paying for their silence.
This is business.	End of story.
This is your problem.	It should come out of your end.
Just take it out of mine.	All right? Go for it.
I don't care.	Just take it.
No Jesse, thank you, but no.	I'll pay my share.
So how are you feeling? Okay, I guess.	Broke it off with Andrea.
I had to.	She's gonna tell Brock.
If only we had listened.	It's not right to put this on you.
CV shaft, boots, joints, axle-- Replaced all of it.	No way around it.
I went after market on most of the parts here.	You want me to swap in factory parts, that's fine.
Anything else? That's it.	Zero balance, like I said.
Then it's a bargain.	You give me 50 bucks, and she's all yours.
You sure about this? Sure as	I'll check the register.
I'm at work right now.	Yeah, I know.
This is a heads-up.	You got visitors.
We met briefly in Albuquerque.	Uh, yes, we did.
You can't expect me to do that stuff.	I mean, let's be realistic.
Mike, this is crazy.	I'll send a new guy.
Watch your language.	And, yes, I did.
Yeah? Yes? - No.	No, I won't.
I'm just-- - You're saying yes.	No! No, no.
That was kidding.	We didn't shake on it.
That doesn't count! I know you don't approve.	But mine we'll call it a birthday present to myself.
They're both leases.	So it all fits our story.
He's a year away from college.	Why on earth would we do that? I don't know.
Listen, I know these last few weeks have been rough.	The threat to Hank and this whole thing with Beneke.
For all of us.	You know, a birthday party.
Hey, mom, you forgot something.	Hmm? - Dad's bacon.
Well, it is sort of a tradition.	Watch this, Holly.
" Kind of is.	Just a little.
He's Fring's head of "corporate" security.	He's a definite hard case.
Now, we're gonna stay on him.	We're putting together a surveillance team as we speak.
I don't know.	Like I said, there's still a lot of questions.
It's a big step up.	It's not without its headaches.
What's up? Me? Nothing.	Thought you'd be more jazzed about the new job.
I believe you.	Just don't kill us
Marie, you've been moping around the last few days.	Marie? What's up? - Marie, come on.
Bye, drive safe.	Drive safely, okay? - I do.
Great dinner, Skyler.	Those were some bad-ass whipped potatoes, I tell you.
Yeah, right? - Yeah.	Seems like longer, doesn't it? - Yeah.
Day after my 50th.	Honestly, I never thought I'd make it this far.
I just wanted to quit.	But you guys-- You got me through it somehow.
Kept me going.	And that happened again and again and again.
And she's singing to me.	And this would go on and on, day after day.
It was I just wanted it to stop.	Skyler, isn't that freezing? Whoa.
I, uh-- I might've heard a little bit about that.	I mean, hey, look, Marie didn't go into detail.
There's Marie's guy, Dave.	She seems really happy with him.
I think it's a great idea.	Just the thing for both of you.
I gave Marie bottles.	They'll stop and pick up diapers on their way.
What a coincidence.	I know you're awake.
Skyler, we have talked about this repeatedly.	It has never been more safe.
It is not.	You're right back in the meth business again.
This is different.	Now I'm running things.
You can't make that promise, Walt.	I can promise you that Gus Fring is dead.
And he was the threat.	He was the danger.
Because of what I did.	Skyler, you can't brat yourself up over this
They come home.	To this house.
Everything in my power.	Like what? I mean, specificly.
Let Hank and Marie see we're still struggling.	No, more like you're still struggling.
But you're right.	It's a bad plan.
I don't have any of your magic, Walt.	I don't know what to do.
I'm a coward.	I-- I can't go to the police.
I can't stop laundering your money.	I can't keep you out of this house.
I can't even keep you out of my bed.	All I can do is wait.
Look at that.	You tell me what that looks like.
They made these things to put under cars.	They can get wet.
Wait, wait, wait.	What? Lydia planted this thing, not the cops.
I don't think so.	I vote it's a voting thing.
White? The methylamine keeps flowing, no matter what.	We are not ramping down.
We're just getting started.	Nothing stops this train.
They're watching Ratatouille.	It's very sweet.
What's your name? - Todd.	Stop! Lydia planted this thing, not the cops.
Hey, there, Walt.	How you doing, buddy? - Good.
If it's a bad time, I could No, no.	I'm just kind of settling into the new digs here.
What do you think, huh? Wow.	It is very nice.
Oh, well, thanks.	You know, my days of chasing dirt-balls is over.
Yeah, hey, somebody's gotta go chase the bad guys.	Walt, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
Was it a birthday present? Uh, yeah.	Well, I mean, not-- not really.
Hey, have a seat.	New car, new watch.
I'm glad you're on it.	That's not something you wanna let fester.
What do you mean? You don't have to ask that.	It's great having them.
They're great kids.	I appreciate that.
Listen, I'm gonna get a coffee.	You want a coffee? - Yeah.
Um You want cream and sugar? Yeah.	Hank, I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.	That Cup of coffee, right? All right.
Just take a moment.	Take a moment.
You'll pull out your gun and shoot	And where will I shoot you? - In the
And it's a pistol, not a	I'm expecting precision here.
We up and running? Yeah.	Um, computer's set.
A device? - Yeah.	I-I guess you'd call it that.
Why? Oh, I don't know.	I figured as much.
I-I know what you're thinking, but I didn't do it.	I'm telling you, I didn't plant that thing.
So the warehouse is too hot.	Her supply is useless to us now.
I'll deal with her.	No! No, no, no.
It sounds like she's telling the truth to me.	She has a gun to her head,
Everyone sounds like Meryl Streep with a gun to their	I'm sorry, Jesse.
We epoxied them to the bottom.	They were well-hidden.
Oh, really? Well, not well-hidden enough.	How many barrels you tag? All of them.
She saved our asses by finding that thing.	She was saving herself.
Talk about what? You heard.	You can't even get us a single barrel.
It's not a trick question.	Why don't you just answer it? Yes, I have children.
Please don't patronize me.	I hate that.
You have none.	But trust has to work both ways, Lydia.
Nine of them.	They know everything about me.
There's a remote three-mile stretch here, in Mckinley County.	That's where you do it.
You are offering us a quick trip to prison.	That's what I'm hearing.
It's a dead zone.	No automated supervision system, no alarms, no contact with control.
But we're way out in the boonies.	I don't care if it's in the Gobi desert.
Give me a break.	You guys were gonna murder
I thought you were professionals.	Can you say "ASAC"? "Aaay-SAC.
Don't listen to him, Holly.	Aw, I'm just telling it like it is, babe.
Say, "boss man.	" Am I the boss man? I'm the boss.
See? - Okay.	She doesn't want it.
No, she wants me.	She wants me.
Yeah, my little girl, 'cause I'm not giving her back.	Yeah, I know.
Hey, I picked up Heat on BluRay.	Wanna watch it with me later? No.
You mean switch back to a pseudo cook.	You're the chemist.
Admittedly, it's gonna cut down on our output.	Like a factor of four or five.
Wait a minute.	It's perfect! Yeah, we do it here.
We do it right here.	How are we looking, Mike? All clear.
How we doing, by the way? Uh, 850.	We're almost there.
Damn, you guys thought of everything.	Flynn Flynn, open the door.
That's all I have to say.	What's going on? You got what you wanted, that's what.
I'm not gonna ask twice.	What? You know what.
We explained that to you.	You haven't explained jack shit.
Because we're your parents, and you're our child.	That's reason enough.
Don't start, Walt.	I won't change my mind about you.
You're my wife.	I'm not your wife, I'm your hostage.
Think you've seen too many movies.	Our children are not in danger.
Last name-- up to you.	Out burying bodies? Robbing a train.
Yeah? It's me.	I've got it.
Right? Think it's, uh Think it's in there or something.	You think? - Yeah.
Good? - Yeah.	Go! It looks good up here.
How about this one? Hold up.	There it is.
I think this is the one.	We good? - Yeah.
Ready? - Ready.	Nothing? - Try again.
Uh Maybe if we all pushed? All right.	It's worth a try.
You got any other ideas, you just shout them out.	Not at the moment, I don't.
You coming? So far, so good.	Give me a status.
Uh, we're at And water is going Now.	Water's going in now.
We're going with water now.	Good? - Yeah.
Doesn't make any sense.	Everything looks good.
Picked a hell of a place to break down.	I know, right? Crazy.
Hey, you know anything about engines? Not a whole lot.	I can push you off the tracks at least.
Won't get a scratch.	You'll screw up your nice shiny bumper.
Hey, we're running late because of you, buddy.	The man said it was no problem.
You pull your guys off that train right now.	We're not done yet.
The track is clear, Walter.	I said get outta there.
Glad we could work that out for you.	Yeah, no problem.
Obviously, I guess you see it different.	Some of you.
Well, it's not like I wanted to.	The kid was on a dirt bike.
A threat? The kid was waving at us.	He wasn't going anywhere.
He was saying hi.	Yeah, but you don't know that.
Yeah, I do.	He didn't know what he'd seen.
I want to be a real part of this.	All right? If you could just see that.
That dude? Whack-job.	Let's just stick to the facts here.
We, us three, should've had a discussion about it.	We would've figured it out.
It's true, though.	He does have some connections.
Is this a problem? No.	It's nothing to be concerned about.
It came up in the background I did on him.	Didn't worry me then.
Two We dispose of him.	Which leaves us option three.
We keep him close.	Under our control.
Now, option three would be my choice.	Shall we vote? I vote three, kid.
What's up? I was just in the neighborhood.	Anything going on? No.
He's just hanging out with his granddaughter.	Well, isn't that sweet? Here, let me see.
It's a dead drop.	What? - A dead drop.
He just stashed something underneath that trash can.	Write the time down.
Roll on it.	Looks like he's leaving now.
The guy's a pro.	Yeah, well, even pros make mistakes.
One of these days, our pal Ehrmantraut's gonna slip up.	Just gotta be there when he does.
I don't see much of Flynn.	That car of his keeps him pretty busy.
He's, um, yeah, he's good.	I feel like I'm making progress.
Babe, what is it? It's okay.	It's all right.
I need them to be safe.	The kids? They're safe.
Of course they are.	I just miss them so much.
But I just I don't know what to do here.	I-- Like, whatever I choose is wrong.
Like what? Like you're bad parents? Because you're not.	Not even close.
Marie, there are things you just don't know.	That if you knew, you'd never speak to me again.
If you're not gonna say it, I will.	Skyler, you have to forgive yourself for Ted.
You were having all these problems with Walt.	And Ted is a really good-looking man.
Where's your cars? We parked around the block.	You might consider doing that as well.
This has been going on for a while now.	Did they follow you here? No.
And I said calm down.	I've got it under control.
Oh, well, forgive me for not having complete confidence.	You know this can't go on, right? Yeah, I know.
But I really don't see any other way.	Neither do I.
White, um I'm out too.	You're what? I don't think I can do this anymore.
It's a solid plan.	You can come in on this with us.
You'll be selling to my competitors.	This guy and his crew are way out in Phoenix.
It's a big country, Walter.	Whole lot of meth-heads.
There's no one there.	You sure? I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
Glad to see you could make it out.	I was surprised to get your call.
Good surprise, I hope.	There's one gallon, as discussed.
You take that back home to your people, test it.	If you're satisfied, I can get the other 665.
You see, that doesn't work for me.	I'm not just buying this for the supply.
I'm buying this for the demand.	I'm looking to increase my market share here, Mike.
It's not mine to sell, Declan.	Well then, no deal, Mike.
I don't know.	Why don't you come over here? To my house.
We would be out.	You could spend time with your family.
It's not selling out.	Yes, it is, Jesse.
But nothing earth-shattering.	'Course, we all knew the potential.
But for personal reasons, I decided to leave the company.	And I sold my share to my two partners.
I look it up every week.	And I sold my share, my potential, for $5,000.
I sold my kids' birthright for a few months' rent.	This isn't the same thing.
I'm in the empire business.	I don't know.
You have a lovely home.	I was just heading out.
I like that you got the slivered almonds going.	My mom always made them like that.
Because these are choice.	I, uh, I eat a lot of frozen stuff.
White said it's going really well.	He was, like, you're a-- you're a great manager.
This business is all I have left now.	It's all I have.
And you want to take it away from me.	I thought you might try something stupid.
Look, Mike-- - Don't bother, Walter.	Come join me in the office.
I don't think so.	That's not a request.
Might as well get comfortable.	This deal's going down tomorrow.
Like it's my birthday.	Mike-- When the deal is done, you'll get your money.
I guarantee that.	Let me cook it.
I'm gonna have to restrain you.	You gotta be kidding.
Turn around for me.	Arms out to the side.
Different strokes and all.	But sadly, he's just not that into you.
Expect a visit from the sheriff, agents.	You should have your ex parte within the hour.
For the moment.	TRO won't stand up, and Goodman knows it.
He's right about that TRO.	It's gonna get tossed toute suite.
Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.	So have fun with that.
White's got an idea.	Mike, I'm serious.
Is that true, Walter? Everybody wins.	Full thousand gallons, not a drop less.
You're on your own.	Looks like you're about 1,000 gallons light here, Mike.
Only I do.	And you're dealing with me now, not him.
You already ape my product at every turn.	But now you have the opportunity to sell it yourself.
You all know exactly who I am.	Say my name.
I'm the cook.	I'm the man who kill Gus
Are you sure? That's right.	Now say my name.
We'll figure it out.	Well, I guess that's it.
The DEA will do a sweep.	Can't say when.
When I'm out, I'm out.	Well, I'm out, too, Mike.
Kid just look out for yourself.	Are we good? You tell me.
Is there bacon in these? Oh, my God! Just bits.	Just little bits of bacon.
Just enough to make those suckers really pop.	Dan, this is too much.
I'm not sharing those.	Bad office etiquette? I don't give a crap.
Good, 'cause my husband's not getting any either.	How is Mickey? - Don't get me started.
Oh, I don't know.	A boat might be nice.
I'll tell you that right now.	And the last one is 545.
Slow and steady wins the race.	So I guess this is it for a while? Mm.
Don't worry about the families.	They'll keep getting their deliveries.
When a cop kill himself, they want a full	A single contact wound.
Powder burn on his temple and right hand.	su1c1de, I think.
When I found him, he-- he was dead.	Hey! Perfect timing.
White-- - I mean way too long.	Now we have a tremendous amount of residue.
Doubling down? - Mm-hmm.	Cooking 100 pounds a week, not 50.
Why not? You deserve it.	You're every bit as good as me.
Well, what do you think? Mr.	White, uh, I think that nothing has changed for me.
You have such emotional depth.	No, no, no, no.
You shouldn't touch that dirty money.	I'll save you from that, Jesse.
You want it just as much as I want it.	And it's not wrong to want it.
Yes, you do.	It's on you, all right? - I'm done.
No, you're not.	You're not done.
I'll work on it.	It'll get better.
It's that simple.	I believe you.
You got a bigger job than that.	I mean, forget the financial cost.
You're damn right it won't.	I'm just gonna bottom line this for you.
The surveillance budget for Ehrmantraut is now zero.	We clear? Sure.
Something like that.	No more following Ehrmantraut.
Not worth the financial investment.	Well, it's not like the guy's going anywhere.
I do all right? You did fine, Todd.	You applied yourself.
That's as much as I can ask.	Now all that's left, I guess, is to talk money.
Here you go buddy.	Oh, thank you, Hank.
Tell me something good.	You tell me.
I sweated the guy for 14 hours.	That should be some kind of record.
Quit your bragging.	What'd you get? He's gonna do it.
Look, there's a small situation with the money.	I don't want to do this on the phone.
Oh, you know what? I'm not far.	I'll come to you.
You just hang tight.	Yeah? Mike, they're coming for you.
Slow down, Walter.	Who? - The DEA.
The DE-- Somebody flipped.	They have, uh, some-- some kind of bank surveillance.
Always consult with me before using outside counsel.	All right, Saul.
The what? - The, uh Walt and Jesse are here.	I don't want Walt and Jesse, Saul.
I want you.	I need your help.
I'm paying Saul.	He can do the job just fine.
Before I hand this over, I need something from you.	And what's that? The names of your nine men.
Why? You're never gonna pay them off.	What's the point? The point is, Mike, it affects me.
It affects Jesse, too, and we deserve to know.	The only thing left to do now is leave town.
Yeah, I just can't up and leave, like you, Mike.	I've got a family.
You owe me that much.	I don't owe you a damn thing.
It was perfect.	But, no, you just had to blow it up.
I can get them from her.	I'm sorry, Mike.
This-- this whole thing could've been avoided-- Shut the fuck	Let me die in peace.
You owe me that much.	I don't owe you a damn thing.
I just realized that Lydia has the names.	I can get them from her.
White? Hello? Mr.	White, the, uh, car's been dealt with, sir.
So what's the story? You get to Mike? Mm-hmm.	He get out safe? He's gone.
All charges dropped.	Queen for a day and a five-K.
Guys, come on.	You can be a fairy princess, for all I care.
I got plenty you don't know.	You seem a little confused.
So settle in, Dennis.	Enjoy your new home.
I'm gonna go rattle some cages.	So? Maybe you should order something.
Do you want a coffee or something? Not just now.	I think this would play better if you ordered something.
Lydia, you've come all this way.	You do have the list? - Yes, I have it.
Ten names now.	Ten, counting the lawyer.
And I checked.	The average purity is only about 60 percent.
They've never seen anything like your product.	You'll blow their hair back.
Shipping internationally seems like courting disaster.	Not if you're Madrigal.
Madrigal is under investigation by the DEA.	The restaurant division, mostly.
They're professional and very amenable.	I'm very careful who I work with.
Todd, I think it's time I meet your uncle.	No iron pile.
There's too many muscle-heads flexing their shit.	Too many eyes.
Okay, so no chow line, no yard.	Gonna keep it simple.
Hallways, shower room, cells.	The easy stuff.
I say we go with a riot.	Our boys get it done in a riot.
Have him switch with somebody.	I don't know.
