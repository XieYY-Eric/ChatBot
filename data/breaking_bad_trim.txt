Well, thank you.	You're late again.
Yeah. I think it's getting better.	What the hell is this?
It's veggie bacon. We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.	Not me. I want real bacon. Not this fake crap.
Too bad. Eat it.	This smells like Band-aids.
Eat your veggie bacon.	You all set?
Yeah, I'm fine.	All right, see you at home.
Okay, see you.	Chemistry. It is the study of what? Anyone? Ben.
She's showing a little.	Carmen, this is my sister Marie.
Nice, isn't it?	Dad, come check this out.
Yeah, I see it.	Come on, take it.
Check it out, Walt.	No, no, it's just heavy.
Were any shots fired?	No, ma'am. Our agents took the suspects by surprise.
That faux-Lalique vase I picked up at the Super-Swap.	How's it doing?
Until what time? Noon? 1-ish?	Probably 2, more like it.
What is going on down there?	No, it's just...
You understood what I've just said to you?	Yes. Lung cancer. Inoperable.
Phosphine gas. I think.	Yeah, exactly. One whiff will kill you. That's why the
Driver's license says Emilio Koyama.	Asian! Pay up, sucker.
Oh, my God. Pinkman?	It's me. I'm alone.
I own it.	No one's looking for you.
Somebody bought it?	Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis. 14 dollars plus shipping.
Open offer. So what's up with Walt lately?	What do you mean? He's fine.
So it's a mid-life crisis.	No, he's just quiet.
Guess that answers that.	a round bottom boiling flask.
Buy the RV. We start tomorrow.	How's it coming in there?
Cow house. God help me.	What are you doing?
Would you shut up and help me?	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, work it. Baby, work it.
It's all right? It's all right?	Yeah, it's all right. So, what? You back in business?
I say we cap 'em both.	Hey, you really cook up that batch?
Twelve Hours Earlier	You are a lifesaver.
Dude, you so need GPS. I mean, for real.	Like I said, we couldn't be more grateful.
You have a good day, sweetie.	Okay, Mom. You too.
Oh, no, no not good. Not good.	What the...hey, you. Listen No, no, no, no! Oh, God!
No, not him so much. His cousin, mainly.	Who's his cousin?
The guy out in the RV!	All right, all right.
Krazy-8's one level higher.	One level higher?
I'll do the body in the acid, okay?	Heads or tails?
Not yet. God. I gotta go.	What? No, come back here!
Just a minute. I wanna talk to you.	No, I'm not interested.
Iron. Wow, okay. .00004%.	What? You can't have hemoglobin without iron.
Apparently, it don't take much.	No, it don't. Go figure. Sodium.
What? No! No. What would make you even�	Where's he getting it from?
How do you know my name?	Jesse. He told Emilio and me.
No! No way!	Where the hell do you think you're going?
Back off, man! Jesus!	We've got work to do!
Excuse me. His own mother seems to think so.	Skyler told you that?
She inferred it.	She inferred it, huh?
Good. Scare him straight.	Where's my sugar?
No, not really.	Think you'd like to live here?
A cop and some football player messing with me.	They ask about me? Huh?
What does your dad do?	He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.
Yeah. You do.	I'll get the key.
That's very understanding.	Whatever, man. I just want to go home.
You got something?	I don't know. Just doesn't it seem like something's missing?
What about the soul?	The soul. There's nothing but chemistry here.
I don't know. It's store-bought.	Hank, you need another beer?
Marie, some more wine, maybe?	I'm all right, thanks.
Honey, do you need anything?	No, Walt. Thank you.
What's she talking about? Walt.	I have cancer. Lung cancer. It's bad.
Ask him how long he's known.	I guess a month, maybe, or...
No, thanks, man. Pass.	Your loss. These are from Canada or something. Imported.
Say, Jesse. You still cook a little crystal?	Could be, yeah. You know, from time to time.
Do you need some help?	No, I'm fine, honey. I'm fine. Just Privacy. Thanks.
What's that we're putting on a credit card?	It's just a deposit kind of thing.
What can I do for you?	Which dude? The dude that looked like a lizard?
Dude, play some, play some Jethro Tull.	Hey, guys. How are we doing in here?
Nobody. What are you, nuts?	Then why are you here?
What? I'm just saying.	Go and don't come back. Now!
It was pretty awesome.	Retirement? I can't be hearing this!
It's a stupid gift.	No, it isn't. He'll love it.
Oh, come on.	Sir, I'll take that for you.
Walt! You made it.	Happy birthday. Wouldn't miss it for the world.
Thank you. It's really nice to be here.	When are you due?
Walt? I thought that was you.	Farley! Long time no see.
Well, no. No, that's Gretchen and Elliott.	I gravitated toward education.
Oh God, I miss this, Walt.	Yeah. Me, too.
Look, there's nothing we can't work out.	Well, yeah, but it's complicated.
You ready to go?	I'm taking the bus.
Okay bye, honey.	Hey, dude, are these bullet
No, man. Those are for, like, you know, ventilation.	Cool. Nice set-up, huh?
Okay. We're in business. Right on, Badger.	Dude, check this out.
Jesus, what the hell are you bringing that for?	Hunting. We might see javelinas.
What about him?	Are you kidding? He looks younger than us.
Why do I have to do it?	Give me the crutches and I'll go do it.
No, it's not?	Yeah, it is.
He admitted it. He said he liked it.	Walt? I didn't think he had it in him.
It's not right.	What do you mean it's not right?
We'll just do it again until we get it right.	Walt, please have a seat and join us.
This is bullshit.	Hey, come on.
It's all right. Talk. Tell your dad how you feel.	I'm pissed off.
My husband's life we're talking about!	Ladies. Come on.
How dare you?	This is so stupid.
All right what?	I'll do the treatment. It's gonna be okay.
And then Elliott will send a check.	I will take care of it.
Elliott told me about the cancer. I'm so sorry.	Well, you know, it is what it is, I guess.
Good, that's good news.	You know, that really was a great party.
Keep in touch, okay?	Sure. Sure. Thank you for calling.
No matter what happens, no more bloodshed. No violence.	Walt? You all right?
So we're good. We're good.	Could you not deposit this until Monday? Thank you.
No. I'm just dizzy.	Come here. Sit down, sit down.
I'm burning up.	Take this off. Sit down. Get some air.
Oh, God. Yeah, that's better.	When were you going to tell me?
Tell you what?	Cancer. You got it, right?
Your aunt. How bad was she when they caught it?	Bad enough. She didn't last long.
"Property of J. P. Wynne Chemistry Lab." That's Walt's school.	We were supposed to start at 3.
26 big ones.	Is that all? $26,000?
Yeah, I mean I used to until you kill	So who took Krazy-8's place?
You just don't get it, man. This guy's O.G.	What does that mean?
Wait till Monday again?	Yes, please. Thank you.
I'll need to take a look at that inventory.	Sure. I got a list hanging on the wall.
You mind if I take a look at your storeroom?	Not at all, no. Be my guest.
How about students?	No, no. No students have keys.
We don't want people to start wondering about you, right?	Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.
Hey, man. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.	Break out the ice. Take a bump.
No worries, man. I'm no cop.	I said hit it.
I cooked it.	Bullshit! Who you working for?
See? I told you Tuco would hook you up.	Cool. I haven't said how much.
All right. How much?	35 large for the pound.
You'll get it. This is a consignment operation.	You want me to float 35 G's?
Don't front, dude. Tuco's good for it.	I don't need your punk ass to vouch for me!
Hank's about to deal.	Okay. I'll be right there.
All right. Let's see what the turn brings us.	You're looking good, Walt. Your color's better.
Check's in the mail. 10 million.	Red's 25 million. Blue's 10.
You the guy?	Yeah, I'm the guy. How is he?
Good morning. Would you pass the butter, please?	Bad ass, Dad.
No. Please. No one said anything about LSD.	What about the equipment that was stolen?
I'm here to see the owner.	He's in the recreational vehicle.
Yo, it's appointment only!	How you feeling?
So Tuco gave you this is what you're saying.	We made a deal.
Here we are.	Skyler, you look great.
How do you feel?	Oh, okay. You know, pretty decent actually.
I want all of it. 70 grand.	What did you say?
Okay. That's $65,625 with interest. 1.875 pounds.	No. 2 pounds. Next Friday. And no production problems.
Thank you. Look at the little feet.	From me. And Hank.
You think it's a good idea?	Hank, I've already got lung cancer.
Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?	It's funny, isn't it? How we draw that line.
You mean like pot?	Yeah. Like pot. Or whatever.
Methylamine. Where's the methylamine? I don't see the methylamine.	Yeah, well, that's where I ran into some trouble.
So why don't we just steal it ourselves?	Yeah? How are we going to do that?
So who gave it to you, then?	I don't think I have to tell you that.
I don't know. There he is.	Yeah, I see him.
Wait till he passes.	Okay, it's clear. What the hell is this?
Oh, God. Carry your bag.	What? What are you doing?
Okay, there is it.	Is this going to be loud?
Where are the gallon jugs?	I don't know.
How is it going to be any different?	Can I just try it?
What part of slow it down did you not understand?	You talk too much. It's heavy, man.
What were you doing at Zachary's?	I was returning it.
Excuse me. I'd just like to see the basement.	Yeah, well, it's occupied.
So how was it? Was it an experience?	Yeah. It was definitely an experience.
What's that smell?	Yeah. It's sacred Navajo herbs and, hey, is everything okay?
Just remember who you're working for.	What did you say?
Just remember who you're working for.	What did you say?
Do something? He needs an ambulance. He needs a hospital.	Do something! You're smart, right? Do that thing!
No, there's nothing.	Breathe into his mouth.
This is conjecture?	Yes. And conjecture isn't helping.
What do you mean how would I do it?	Specifically, how would you do it? Step by step.
Three shots, or, I don't know, two.	But is it two, or is it three?
Obviously she's not home.	What was that about Chinese?
Dinner tonight. That new place.	How late they serve?
I don't know.	You got Dave at 8.
This is them. Check this out.	Holy shit. What was that?
How would he know where I live?	You're sure it was Tuco?
We are going to process them into ricin.	Rice and beans?
No, come on in.	I should've called first. I'm sorry.
What can I do for you?	Maybe we ought to sit down first?
That's all it takes?	That's all it takes.
Not if Tuco kill us	Just keep it down. Hey, Hank. What's up?
Me and my big mouth, I guess.	Well, that happens. It's no problem. No worries.
Well, thanks, man. I appreciate that. Jesus, the wives, huh?	Hank, unfortunately, I really...
Do you mind if I get in there?	No, go ahead.
I don't know where to begin.	What the hell are you doing here?
Damn. You don't think he...Holler if you need me.	Thanks a lot, man. Appreciate that.
I'm looking into it.	What phone call?
Second cell phone.	Yeah. I'm thinkin' that.
Get away from me!	Settle down, bitch!
Don't do this, Tuco.	No more posters?
Yeah, man. I mean, me, neither.	Who's talking to you?
We can't just ignore a potential clue, Hank.	Okay. What are you talking about?
Walt? Please. What about the marijuana?	He's not on pot anymore.
Oh, my God. Is my son in trouble?	I have absolutely no reason to think that, no.
Jesus! I don't want to die!	Tell me what you did!
Let him bleed. The keys! Oh, my God. The cousins?	What the hell's going on?
My God. I'm so sorry. Come here.	You know who I am, right?
What a day this has been?	So, Uncle Hank. He was in a
But where did this happen? How could he be...	Walt, everything's okay. We're all okay.
And no idea what caused it?	But they're gonna run a whole series of tests, so.
What other matter?	An unrelated family matter.
They need probable cause.	"Probable cause?" Yo, what'd you do? Rob a bank?
God, Badger! Don't mess with me! Got it?	I got it.
My God. Okay, that's all of it.	This is a bad choice.
You sure about this guy?	He's totally, totally cool. He's my cousin.
Yo, what'd we say, 500?	We didn't say, and it's 1,000.
$1,000? C'mon, where you towing it, man, Seattle?	It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.
That right? You a "stand-up dude?"	Yeah, I am. I will get you the other $500.
What's the last thing you remember?	I was driving home. I think.
Yeah, we're looking really good.	Thank God. So, what was it, then?
That may still be a ways down the road.	"A ways down the road?"
Three days, you must have got hungry.	Yeah, I guess.
Why didn't you answer your cell phone?	It was in my car.
Like what, like, like this?	That's not mine.
The kid with the crutches. The football player.	How about we stay on topic?
Buenas tardes, se�or Salamanca. �Entiendes en ingl�s?	What's that mean?
Did he mention my name?	No, thanks for caring.
And the RV?	Badger's cousin took it to his garage. It's safe.
So we can cook.	So you still wanna cook? Seriously?
What's changed, Jesse?	737,000. 21 pounds, minus cash on hand...cash on hand.
Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?	No, I was awake.
You sneaky bastard, you!	Very nice work.
You shouldn't have. You sick, sick puppies. I love it!	You going to finish your apple juice?
But I'm not thirsty.	Dad. Drink it.
You got a better idea?	Okay, fine. Whatever. So when do we, you know?
In the kitchen.	I didn't know you were allowed to touch the stove.
I wanted to. Grapefruit juice?	Yes, please. Thanks.
There you go. Honey?	I'll stick with orange, thank you.
You wouldn't know any current bands.	That's besides the point.
Boz Scaggs. There's another one.	Whoever they are. Thanks for breakfast.
Wait. What? You're kicking me out of my own house?	It's your aunt Ginny's house.
She gave it to me.	She never gave it to you, Jesse.
What happened is you're a speed manufacturer.	No, I'm not. What?
I think that's great.	Jesse. Jesse. Hey, Jesse. You don't answer your phone?
No, Mom! Mom! Where am I supposed to go?	I don't know, sweetheart. But please turn your life around.
Yeah, this is gonna help big time with that! Bitch!	Oh, hey, Mr. White.
New Mexican Christmas style, red and green chilies.	No. Thank you, though. Flynn and me gotta get going.
What's wrong with Walter Jr?	Don't take it personally. He wants his own identity.
You think he told Louis about me? About the blackout?	Louis is his friend, Walt, and your disappearance upset him.
I made omelets.	I'm going out, but thanks, though.
Where are you going?	Can you get the phone, please?
Yeah. Absolutely. White residence.	Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?
What part of "no contact" didn't you understand?	I know but there's a problem.
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic out there female-wise.	Damn. I'm hating, man.
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.	Hey, Ben, I think it's someone's nap time. Come on.
What the hell you doing here? You smell like shit.	It's a long story.
So ask me.	Why? Would you even tell me?
Are you actually this stupid?	No, look. I know this isn't optimal...
So, we're not going through an insurer. Is that correct?	Yes. Direct bill.
Just need to print it out for you.	Thank you. I thought we had discussed a cash discount.
No. The hospital bill came.	That was fast.
I'm surprised his head still fits through the door.	Hey, wanna grab lunch?
Here's the man.	Hey, congratulations, Hank.
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.	What about that one?
Utilities are included.	Stacking. Sweet. You got cable?
What are you doing?	brat' off. What's it look
Okay, so what's the plan?	The plan is we cook.
I got bills, man.	You've got bills?
There's a third way.	And what would that be?
You don't get to vote.	I beg your pardon? This is a partnership, remember?
Good deal, mover. Good deal.	Yo. Badge, hey.
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.	Nah. They burn in, yo.
It's gonna be pretty much sparse. Very Asian-y, modern stuff.	Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
You got any other refreshments?	I could kick it. It's been a while.
That's kinda, like, hopeful, bro.	Street's maybe 17, 18.
It's an armpit.	It's not an armpit.
You know perfectly well, Marie.	Well, obviously I don't.
Hell, yeah, it was freakin' scary, you little punk. Jesus.	But you were way faster than him.
Well, I'm here, aren't I?	Hell, yeah. Kick ass and take names.
I wasn't sure it was you. New car?	Yeah, keeping things on the D.L.
I'm guessing this one doesn't bounce.	Your half. That's what I'm talking about. You're welcome. Jesus.
What up? Damn, bitch.	Got something for me?
Yeah, I found them.	Is this a 5 or an S?
5. No, wait. S. Yeah, a 5.	Jesus, how the hell do you spell "street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?
I think it's gonna be a nice day, huh?	Yeah, high 70s.
You have a great day.	Right on. You too.
You dropped it!	Shut the hell up about it.
Very nice to meet you, Flynn.	Nice to meet you, too.
Though a bald head is a bit of a shocker.	I know it was for me.
For good luck. Right?	Exactly. Here's hoping. We could use some of that, huh?
Nice meeting you.	Likewise. Bye now.
I just want to say, man...	What? What do you want to say?
Serious, I might have a concussion!	Don't fall asleep, baby.
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.	You shut up!
Shut up, skank.	Shut up! Stop it!
So? It's FIDC insured. It's a victimless crime.	Where the hell did you get this?
I'm telling you. A victimless crime.	Jesus! Come on already!
Stop calling me that! I ain't no skank!	Skank, skank, skank ass skank!
And I apologize deeply.	Now please tell me why you did it.
You are always the picture of innocence.	You left me.
They're cutting off the money.	What did she say, exactly?
And yet she still drives a Bentley.	Keeping up appearances or I don't know. Who knows?
Baby, that H is bringing me down.	You took too much. I told you.
And you knocked, right? He didn't answer? Which means?	Look, I'm his father, all right?
You're Mr. Jackson?	That's me. Walt Jackson. And you are?
I called the cops.	You called the cops?
It's Badger, man.	What are you doing? Don't use your real name.
You get on. All right? I just want to forget.	Sorry. What's up with that?
It ain't real, dumbass.	Watch it, is all.
Man, that's church, yo. For real.	What have you heard?
Serious. But, like he really did it?	You didn't hear that from me.
Wow, handsome. Oh, my God. Good genes.	Speaking of movie stars, those can't be the twins.
Walt, how's he doing?	He is doing great. He's plugging away.
You're kidding. You were like our go-to bookkeeper.	The economy, you know, so.
Because it's not our territory.	Because we lack initiative.
I'm a blowfish.	You are a blowfish. Say it again.
I'm a blowfish.	Say it like you mean it.
We'll get you three.	You give me ten.
Speak of the devil.	How are you? What's up?
This is Raisin Bran, not Raisin Bran Crunch.	So? Same thing.
Dad, notice anything?	Is there a funeral today?
A funeral? Christ, do I look that bad?	Mom got a job.
Corner the market, then raise the price. Simple economics.	Come on in.
I figured that might be a deal-breaker.	Listen, I wanted to thank you for having me back.
You don't have to thank me. I need you.	It's a little early for wine, isn't it?
All right. I'm hitting it.	You dudes give up that easy?
Which dude? That dude? No way. He'd kick my ass.	True that. This is so hard, you know?
So go ahead and ask.	Are you a cop?
Not like that. Ask it, like, official.	Are you a police officer?
I was out partying, minding my own business.	You are under arrest.
I really need to get some furniture.	I suggest you start with a bed.
God, I wish we could smoke in here.	Well, you can't.
What'd I say?	Nothing. I just have to go is all.
I just think it's asking a lot.	He knows it. He's done nothing but apologize.
Baby, not now.	It's me, Hank. Sorry.
Hey, buddy. What's up?	I just, do you mind if I...So how you doing?
Playing it by ear. "To be determined."	Think you might want to talk it through with somebody?
Do it again. Go on.	$10,000 even. Same as last time. It's totally accurate.
Not yours, I take it.	We got 10, 20, 30, 44, five each.
Then wake him up. He can sleep after we're paid.	Why you gotta be such a hard on?
Honey, I'm home! Too slow! What's up?	You've got more lives than a damn cat.
We are hanging out, Badger. You like Badger or Brandon?	I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution.
And Badger's gonna spill?	Like the Exxon Valdez.
So what do we do about it?	Francesca, how about I follow you home?
Wait a minute. This is in regards to what's-his-name?	Badger! Brandon Mayhew.
He just goes by Heisenberg.	How old's this Heisenberg?
Average, I guess. Medium height, medium weight.	What color hair?
There's more than one kind of prison.	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Wait a minute.	What? What? Let me see. Who the hell is that?
I don't know.	Mr. Heisenberg, I presume. Time to move?
Not till we see the exchange.	What? Now he shows.
I don't get it. What's the holdup?	Where's the stuff, man?
Where are we going?	Just shut up. Get out. Go stop him.
Schrader, I'm blocked.	Not a good time.
How you doing? Are you feeling okay?	Schrader, I'm blocked.
We're working. You gotta get out of here.	You're working? Like DEA working? Is something going down?
Wrong guy! Wrong guy! Other bench.	Move your ass now!
Okay. I'll go and leave you alone.	We'll talk about it later. Just floor it! Floor it!
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?	I'm no Vito Corleone.
You all right in there? You okay?	I'm fine, thank you.
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.	How much time they giving you?
At this time, $16,000.	How long have you been doing this?
Who is it?	Boy, you need some educating.
Hold on, hold on. Sorry. One sec. What?	I've been trying to reach you. Where's your drop phone?
I've been busy.	Clear your social calendar. We have to cook.
Tuesday? Four days straight?	Like it or not, we have no choice.
And why, exactly, is that?	Our methylamine. It's going bad.
All right, all right. Go.	I wish you didn't have to do this.
Three entire bags of Funyuns?	What? Funyuns are awesome.
How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh?	Man, I'm getting no service.
How are you even alive?	Yo, check your phone. You get any bars?
I've got a signal.	Let me use yours, would ya?
Oh, God. Not there. That is our work station.	Our work station.
You said raise the prices.	All right, that's 40 times 42, minus distribution charges.
Six hundred and...	Seventy-two thousand dollars each.
I left 'em right here in the ignition.	Son of a bitch.
That is not what happened.	How do you know?
About another 15 miles.	Really? That far?
I'm trying to trickle-charge the battery.	Seriously? Just by turning that thing?
It has to work. You understand?	Can I try? How much longer?
I don't know.	You hanging in?
Do you have any money? Change, I mean. Coins.	I got a bunch of them.
A battery. Move!	This doesn't look like any battery I ever saw.
Sorry, buddy. No can do.	My son! My bottle! My house!
It's all right.	What are you waiting for? Bring it back.
You want me to go back to bed?	I guess that'd be kind of...
Need some help?	I got it. Just have a seat.
Is there any coffee?	Yeah, shit. One second.
I can tell. Fork?	There you go.
But we're really optimistic.	Great. Good news is great.
Yeah, it is. It really is.	Feel free to bring these any time.
You want installation, right?	No. I'm gonna do it myself.
That's what I like to hear.	And who's this? This guy can surf without a board?
Shut up. Like you never wanted a superpower.	Is that your door or mine?
I don't know.	It sounds like mine. I gotta go.
Hey. This your dad?	This is the new tenant.
Son, about yesterday...	I'm sorry about the pool.
I have some tools to put away.	You want to catch a movie later? What?
Before. With your dad.	It wasn't about anything.
So I totally just misread your total dis?	If anything, I was doing you a favor.
I bought a filter.	And I figured the less he knows, the better.
That's all you think you're doing?	Why do you even care about my dad?
You and me.	Who's you and me?
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.	I don't really see anything.
Not if I can help it.	You bucking for a promotion? Go home already.
I guess it just doesn't feel any different.	The good news?
Are you going to work today?	Skyler, there's rot.
You don't have to do that.	You're buying the wrong matches.
There he is. That's the guy.	Stay out of my territory.
When's the due date?	It's the 21st.
Which one is he?	You did not just say that to me.
You said expand the territory!	That doesn't mean you become careless!
We're in the big time now. So where's the kingpin?	Your guess is as good as mine.
That's why I left 40 minutes early.	Sorry. What did I miss?
For your refrigerator.	Oh, my God. Look at her. Look. God.
Isn't that Friday the 13th?	We have a birthday.
You cannot deny your employer his birthday wish.	Yes, I can. Watch me.
He wasn't there.	He was there all right.
Call him back.	I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Diet Coke, please. And five minutes of your time.	What can I do for you?
Are you familiar with my product?	I've been told it's excellent.
I like to mix some ice with it. Hold that.	What's it feel like?
Excuse me, where's the manager?	I'm the manager. Can I help you?
Where is it? Where'd you hide the meth?	In the kitchen.
Are you okay? Is everything okay?	Everything's okay. I just wish you'd been here.
What about that guy next door?	What do you mean?
Oh, hi, Carmen. Just Carmen.	Come on. Hurry up.
That baby's hungry.	Give me that baby. Aw, sweetie. Come on.
Jeez, Sky. Not at the table. We're eating.	Hank, it's only a breast.
It's my sister-in-law's breast.	You are so provincial.
I wish. Mom's even talking about me getting a job.	That's right. Everybody pitches in.
Hammacher Schlemmer makes a proper one of those. It's hypo-allergenic.	I think a towel will do. What is it?
Your son. He's just unbelievable. Come see what he did.	I told you it's not ready yet.
Honey, just show it to them.	My God, son. That's wonderful.
I don't understand why you need him.	Exactly. My point exactly.
Dad, let him go!	Get away from me, man. Back off. Back off!
You miserable little smackhead. Get the hell out!	Hey, I pay my rent, bitch! I got civil rights!
Jesse, come on. Please, no. Come on.	I pay my rent.
What are you doing? What are you doing?	I am calling the police.
I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Tomorrow.	You meant all that?
Just let it ring.	No, I'm gonna go see who it is.
Oh, of course. It really has been a long time.	Jesus. Get somewhere you can talk.
You wouldn't really go to the cops, would you?	We won't have to. He'll pay.
I guess you don't.	You'll never hear from either of us again.
You're not seeing straight, Jesse. You are making a mistake.	Do you know what this is?
Is New Zealand part of Australia?	New Zealand is New Zealand.
We can do that. Definitely.	Excuse me. What can I get you?
To water on Mars.	So, what'd you have? Girl or boy?
A little girl.	That's nice. Congratulations. I have a daughter.
You have other kids?	Just the one.
You all right?	Flynn, get your butt in here.
Look right there. Look at that.	Are those donations?
April 4, 1982.	And mother's maiden name and place of birth.
I don't believe it. Walt, you have to see this!	40 from Terre Haute.
Because maybe your Heisenberg's in prison.	So says APD. They think they got their man.
Awesome. It'll mean more hits.	And more contributions.
Nice to meet you.	Nice to meet you.
Paul Canterna of Canterna Real Estate.	It's a pleasure.
Good to meet you.	And Gustavo Fring of Los Pollos Hermanos.
Please, just Gus.	Got to tell you, you guys make some kill
No. That's my brother-in-law. He's got a health issue.	I'm very sorry. What sort of health issue?
You don't have to do that.	Please. I'm happy to do it.
He is. He's the best.	You don't want to lose him, do you, Walter?
None of us do. We love him.	He's a good man, isn't he?
Yes, ma'am. Totally. My dad is my hero.	Does that put him to sleep?
They'll probably want me to take your glasses.	Yeah, you better.
She's seven weeks tomorrow. Seven, right?	I have a picture here, somewhere.
Shortness of breath?	A bit, but much better.
But he can be on his own? Just more, independent.	Use your best judgment.
Yes. For the last few weeks.	With whom? Who am I having an affair with?
Well, I mean, he certainly knows we're separated, so.	Has he moved out?
Half a million in cash.	That's the spirit. I got it, I got it.
I'll take you to school.	Yeah. No, I'm ready now.
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.	All right, I'm here. See you soon.
So, like, what makes you the expert?	I don't think I ever said I was that.
What the hell's going on in there?	Good morning, officer.
Citing you, sir.	What? What, you don't believe me?
I asked you to stay in the vehicle.	I can get out of my own car.
Take a deep breath, calm down.	This is America, okay?
Step back now.	Did you even hear what I said?
Sir, calm down.	Hellfire rained down on my house where my children sleep!
No, doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.	Why'd the Border Patrol kick this to us?
Hey, Dad. Fixing up the house, huh?	Doing a little work, yeah.
Well, I'll bounce. It's cool.	You doing okay?
She doesn't want me to see the kids.	She said that?
God. It's a disaster.	It is not a disaster.
Oh, my God.	Talk to our friend and get cooking.
Pop-pop! Pop-pop, the ice cream man!	Don't tell your mom.
You want a job?	A job? Who's got a job for me?
Hey. Hey. Thought I'd well visit, if you don't mind.	Of course not. You don't need the room, do you?
Is that right?	If you're gonna do this, it can't be so glaring.
Well, it's not about taking sides, though.	How can you let her treat you like this?
You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?	Better call Saul! I get it all the time.
We feel 875 is very fair.	But I suppose there's always a little wiggle room.
No, that's my offer.	That's less than half-price.
Four hundred thousand. That's my final offer.	Waste of time.
I got dipping sticks.	You've reached Walt's temporary number. Please, leave a message.
Oh, no. Oh, God. This is all we need.	Hey, Mom, Dad. How's it going?
Inside. I bought the place.	It's me. There's something he should know about.
Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me.	What? What the hell are you doing in there?
What is wrong with you?	Skyler, I have every right to be here.
Hey, son. How are you?	Are you back for good?
How was school?	It was good.
Not really? What does that mean?	So are you gonna be at work tomorrow?
Yeah, that's the plan.	Hello, ma'am. We were called about a disturbance?
Sure, man. Whatever.	Okay. Whatever what? I mean, you gonna call him?
Indeed, he is.	So you're in business with this Heisenberg.
My husband makes meth. Methamphetamine.	Your husband's a drug dealer?
What are you talking about?	Ain't jack going on up here. It's quiet as hell.
What you doing?	Calling A.P.D. What do you think?
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.	Where you going?
Gotta take a leak.	Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.
There's an ATM right outside.	Yeah, I don't have a card.
So how does it feel? Does it hurt?	Yeah, it's tight.
Yeah, but is it painful?	It's hard to breathe.
You know what? You called my bluff.	What does that even mean?
Just keep telling yourself that.	What is that supposed to mean?
It's a bad thing.	Hello. Walter White to see Ted Beneke.
I'm sorry. Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.	Okay. I will wait.
Excuse me. Mr. Beneke's not available.	Ted? Come on.
We have a situation.	Walt. Walt. Walt. What are you doing?
Great, drilled right into the stucco.	A little bit of putty, you'll be fine.
Great line of work, by the way. Real upstanding field.	Yeah, well I enjoy it.
No, I moved back home.	That's good, right?
No, this is fine.	So I want an intro to your guy.
Yeah, well, sorry. I can't help you.	Fine, ass-wad. I'll contact the guy myself.
Anytime, loser. Hey, hey, hey! Wait. Hey!	00. This day is dragging.
Okay. I wish I could stay.	So stay. What's stopping you?
I can't believe I remembered that.	Mel who? Does he have a last name?
Do the deal.	You have one unheard message.
Where can I find him, you think?	No idea. Haven't seen him.
Where did this come from, Cara?	I don't know. What is it? Drugs?
Cara. Please, tell me that that camera works.	Damn it. Bingo.
Work it, work it, baby.	Yo, this is sick, brother.
Must be moving mad volume.	It's funny. You wanna know what's funny?
Why don't you go get your dad?	Sure. Hey, Dad. Dad?
What did I just say?	Give me the phone. Give it.
Whatever, man. You owe me that money.	Let me talk to him.
I turned it down. End of story.	Good. Good. Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.
What is this?	Your new lab.
All right, rain check, then.	Great dinner, Mom. Can I be excused?
To do homework or to play video games?	I can multitask.
Could you check again?	Now? Can I do it after the party?
Janice, I'm dead in the water here.	Okay, I'll check.
I'd really like to speak with him.	He's passed away. He was shit two months
Christian Ortega. Was his nickname Combo?	Thanks for this. I really appreciate it.
Miss Peyketewa, she's dead! I need some backup out here.	Okay. On their way.
My unhappiness? My completely out-of-the-clear blue-sky unhappiness? Really?	Look, as you said, for the best.
Brandon Mayhew. I know you. Small world, Albuquerque.	Wanna talk about it?
Oh, yes. Hi. Sorry. I'll be right down.	Hi. Gale Boetticher.
"X-ray crystallography." Really? I could talk about that for hours.	I would love to.
Exactly. But actually, I prefer ether.	Oh, I'll have it for tomorrow.
Gale, I'm wondering how you�	Ended up here?
It is. It is magic. It still is.	"When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer."
Well, can you recite it?	Pathetically enough, I could.
Marie, I'm working.	Did you find it? The RV?
No. Working on it, so�	Why can't you just arrest him, make him tell you?
It's not simple. There's a thing called the Constitution.	Constitution, blah, blah, blah.
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey, how you doing?	Oh, hey, Hank. What's up?
Yo. What, Mr. White?	How's my favorite genius?
Socket wrench. The big one.	What? You scared of the Arabs?
Hey, what about Jesse?	What about him?
He was just having fun. You'll get over it.	No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!
I guess crime does pay.	I don't suppose you just came by to insult me.
Clean, no moisture. Done.	Is our solvent filtered?
I thought you might ask that. Done.	That's good. That's good.
Gale. What temperature did you set here?	Here? Station five, 75 C.
I said 85. 85.	I wrote it down. You said 75. I wrote it.
I look like a TV weatherman.	You want a coffee?
He attacked me?	He swung at you with something.
Swung at me?	He attacked you with a pipe.
I don't think you heard-	I heard you fine. I said no.
Hank, you don't have to do this.	No, I do. I'm good.
They're approaching your car. You have one minute.	I don't get the gag, jagoff. Who is this?
So roll me further, bitch.	What's coming? Male, Caucasian.
BP is 70.	Seven-zero over palp.
Weak and thready at the brachial.	No breath sounds on the right side, belly is rigid.
Appears pale and diaphoretic.	How many entry wounds? Four.
Shoulder and hip, through and through.	Right lung in lower left quadrant, no visible exit wounds.
Let's get him 2 grams of oxygen.	What's his haemoglobin? - Seven-point-three.
Notify the OR, we are on the way.	OR 1 is clear.
Let's put him in there.	Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.
Damn, brother, look at you.	That's messed up.
How are you feeling? You okay? Actually I'm great.	I don't understand.
I thought things were going pretty well.	I thought we were kind of simpatico.
You know? We were becoming a real team.	Not Not so much, no.
You said you liked the configuration.	And I do.
For the most part.	Look, you're a fine chemist, really, with a promising future.
What's up, partner? - I can't believe this.	My replacement? Oh, Jesus.
Nice to meet you.	What's up? Man.
We should've ditched that RV months ago.	It's all, like, shiny up in here.
Makes no sense.	So I guess this is Oh, dear mother of God.
This is for the best.	Two hundred pounds a week.
Okay, there's a lot to show you.	Some new techniques to learn.
Femur's like a wet bag of gravel.	Other one's not much better.
Get those boots off.	See if you get a pulse.
Get blood-pressure cup or an ABI? Where's that blood? Dr.	Bording to Cardiology.
I'm so sorry.	I'm so sorry, honey.
I'm so sorry.	I don't know what to say.
How is he? - I don't know.	They won't really tell us anything.
He's still in surgery.	They shit him four
Hey, how are you, huh? - Fine.	Yeah? Sure? I'm fine.
Probably Mexican nationals.	Their tattoos indicated an affiliation with the drug cartel.
They had an axe.	The cartels tend to be dramatic.
That means I had to take away his	You had to take it.
It's standard procedure.	No one - Okay.
And he would've had a gun and could've defended	Marie, let's just - No.
Just It's their fault.	He didn't have a
I mean it.	Sorry - Go.
You are not welcome here.	The DEA is not welcome here.
It's not just them.	It's you, Walt.
It's all right.	All right, you're done.
Yo, yo, yo.	Jesse Pinkman in the house.
Oh, my dear God.	Walter White to the nearest courtesy phone.
Dude, it's not my schedule.	We have responsibilities here.
I'll get there when I get there.	You know what? Whatever.
I'll just cook on my own.	You will do no such thing.
Jesse, touch nothing.	Stop treating me lik e I'm lik e your assistant.
We really do appreciate that.	What, is your wife there? Yes.
Yes, she is.	She would be happy to know you asked about her.
This fork is absolutely filthy.	Tell me you see this.
You've got good eyes.	Look at that.
Those are not "water spots.	" That's dirt.
This silverware's obviously not been cleaned.	It's covered in germs from someone else's mouth.
God knows what.	Seriously, Aunt Marie, it's water spots.
Ours at home aren't any better.	Yours at home are irrelevant.
We're in a hospital.	They need to be a higher standard.
It's in the same building.	It's all under the same roof.
Lying there, waiting for them to anesthetise you.	Knowing that you may never wake up again.
Anyway, there we are.	We're driving up Central and we hit every green light.
I had that.	Anyway, I survived this place.
Your man is in custody.	God bless America! He's innocent until proven guilty.
We're gonna have to wait for him to stabilize.	How long will that take? I can't really say.
Hey, guys, this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.	Good to meet you.
We were just swapping Hank stories.	That could go on all day.
God knows, there's a million of them.	Meanwhile - Miserable piece of shit.
Guy who shit him, one that's left, he's up	Got the kill going on, resting
Your tax dollars at work.	Gotta see what Hank did to that bastard.
This is Walter White.	I'll connect you.
Yo, we got problems, big ones.	Reverend, so nice of you to call.
You know, I will definitely look into that.	I'll tell you what.
Apparently I'm not worthy of meeting him.	The other one.
The one I'm qualified to speak to.	He started asking questions too.
Lik e why haven't we cook ed anything.	All right, we have a quota.
Oh, I think I'm gonna go wash my face.	I'm going crazy.
Do you wanna come? - Yeah.	Nurse Franklin, please page the operator.
Nurse Franklin, page the operator.	I got candy bars.
Is this what you were asking for? - Yeah.	Yeah? Yeah, I skimmed through it.
No, I assure you.	We are hard at work.
It has my total attention.	We'll cook through week end if necessary.
We will have 400 pounds for you by next week.	I have your word on that? You do.
You have my word on that.	Thank you for the update.
Owner's a big booster for the DEA.	He heard what happened.
I don't even know what to say.	That's an incredible - Good, huh? - Delicious.
That's so generous of you.	Thank you very much.
Yes, thank you.	Guys, did you hear that? Mr.
I only wish I could do more.	Well, we do appreciate your support.
This reward could turn the tide here.	It'll really help.
Again, I can't express how sorry I am.	As it happens, I actually met Agent Schrader.
Fring was one of our sponsors.	I talked for a few minutes with your husband.
As a matter of fact, Mr.	White, your name came up.
Things have improved, yes.	That's wonderful to hear.
Thank you again very much.	It was a great pleasure to meet you.
Let me walk you out.	Oh, no, it's not necessary.
You know, I didn't say thank you.	I'll walk him out.
Be right back.	Good to see you.
It's my pleasure.	May I? May I speak with you? Just a moment.
I am told the assassin that survived is gravely injured.	It's doubtful he'll live.
Thank you again.	You're quite welcome, Mr.
What's going on? What's happening? Starting chest compressions.	One, two, three, four.
One, two, three - Defib? Patient is in asystole.	Continuing chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.	Give me a litre of saline.
I can't get a pulse.	One, two, three, four.
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.	Yes? Juan? I assume you heard the news.
I see things clear enough.	One DEA gets shot, all of Washington starts
I always do.	My brother's a police chief.
I got connections.	They'll get me through.
But don't tak e my word for it.	One taste and you'll know.
Better over than under.	Over by a pound and a half.
We'll just save it out till next week.	We ship it as is.
What, are we running a charity? Come on, man.	We're gonna take it out.
You are paid extraordinarily well.	Why can't you just appreciate that? - Yeah.
Hey, I been crunching numbers.	Oh, you've been crunching numbers? - Yeah.
All right, look, say he's getting 40 a pound.	All right, 200 pounds a week for three months.
Ninety-six million dollars.	Ninety-six million dollars.
All right? Ninety-six million.	Ninety-six to our three.
That is messed up, yo.	That is so messed up.
Is it okay if I visit? Yeah.	His colour looks good.
Gomey, is that you? Buddy, yeah, it's me.	That's you, Gomey? Yeah, Hank.
Hey, check this out.	I got something that'll make you feel better.
Been keeping an eye on that blue meth of yours.	Six, seven weeks, nothing.
Then all of a sudden, boom, it's popping up everywhere.	Look at the new locations.
Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.	Even right here in town.
A teener here and there, you know, strictly street-level amounts.	Man, it's crazy.
Well, three cheers for me.	This thing doesn't do a damn thing.
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.	It's been an hour, right? I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.	I'll go find somebody.
I didn't see it coming.	What? Damn right, you did.
No, I didn't see shit.	Day late and dollar short, as usual.
A voice scrambler.	Could have been anybody.
Are you safe? Absolutely.	Jesse? Jesse? What about you? Face looks better.
Got a job.	Job is good.
It's in a Laundromat.	It's totally corporate.
All kinds of red tape.	My boss is a dick.
You've got all these nice tulips and baby's breath.	Oh, and this is chrysanthemum.
Look at these, Hank.	Aren't they beautiful? - Beautiful.
Wow, look at the size of this basket.	It's got so many goodies in it.
Boss hall of fame.	I don't see anything here from Kleinman.
They're gonna have to get on the stick.	How's everybody doing today? - Good.
Moment of truth? Yeah, I wouldn't call it that.	All right, let's just take a look here.
Oh, I don't know.	Four? - Okay, four.
It looks like some ne function is returning.	Oh, thank God.
And even then, the odds, they're not great.	But you can't know for sure.
Certainly by early next week.	Next week? No, that's not gonna do it.
Actually, she asked the doctor.	Plan-wise, four treatments a week is fairly typical.
Is the health plan's way medically justifiable? Sure.	Is it absolutely optimal? You know, screw it.
I'll make sure he gets what he needs.	They can reimburse me.
Really, I do.	But my best advice is stay in the network.
Don't go out of pocket.	Physical therapy is just the beginning.
To hell with the plan.	There he is.
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.	He's in for the full treatment.
Look around, kiddo.	It's all yours.
What? - This? - Yeah.	You are now the owner of this fine establishment.
For free? - Free? Oh, ladies, cover your ears.	No, not free.
Here's you, right? Pink, Pinkman.	Get it? Okay, here's your cash.
You're out on the town.	Yeah, you're partying hearty.
You're knocking boots with the chicky babes.	Oh, who's this? It's the tax man.
Million times worse.	You're a tax cheat.
Now, you give me your money, okay? That's called placement.	Hand me that little thing Bin.
Final step, integration.	The revenues from the salon go to the owner.
No, that's 17 percent.	I heard you say 5.
You said it right in front of me.	Yeah, that was for your partner.
Listen to reason.	How is your brother-in-law? He'll live.
We're both adults.	I can't pretend I don't know that person is you.
I want there to be no confusion.	I know I owe you my life.
And more than that I respect the strategy.	In your position I would have done the same.
I want security for my family.	Then you have it.
Three million for three months.	That was our agreement.
Extended annually, 12 million a year.	Call it 15.
Free licence to bitch and moan.	How often do you get that?
Forget about money. Assume you have all you want.	I don't know. I guess I would make something.
What happened to the box?	I gave it to my mom.
You know, I didn't give the box to my mom.	I traded it for an ounce of weed.
He's a hero.	You don't deny coverage to a hero.
They'll say they're not denying coverage.	No, no, I'm agreeing with you.
I wanna be there in case he wakes up.	With all they're giving him, he'll sleep till morning.
Oh, you're Ted.	I've heard so much about you.
Thank you for your gift basket.	That was really thoughtful.
Would you like a glass? No, no, thanks.	I'm just on my way home.
I just thought I'd You know, I am really	I think I'm gonna take that bath.
Bad idea to come here.	Ted, I'm I'll see you in a day or two.
Back at the office.	Take as much time as you want.
I can't believe you had to crush the RV.	Must've been, like, depressing.
No one misses it more than me.	Free to cook anytime, anywhere.
All right? Let's start slinging again.	Let's do it.
Life's too short, I say.	Hells yeah, bitches.
We don't need no RV.	All we need is a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles.
Where's your self-respect? Come on.	Ain't top-shelf, but we could at least move it.
Still kind of dry out there.	It'll sell on the street.
I see a couple new faces.	Anybody wanna introduce themselves? Don't all speak at once.
I didn't raise my hand.	No, go ahead.
This is what we do.	Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.
You had it too? - Yeah, bro.	I wish I never even heard of it.
That's the shame of it.	No, no, man.
Don't tell me that.	I hear it's back in town.
It's gonna be okay.	I swear to God, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.	I'll go to 48 Hours.
I'll go to Nightline.	Don't know if there's Nightline anymore.
We can always pay their bills.	Please, it's tens of thousands of dollars.
We have the money, more than enough.	Walt earned it.
Skyler, I really don't think this is a good idea.	I think that - He earned it gambling.
Walt and I we've had our problems lately.	You know that.
And what it all came down to really was money.	Pure and simple.
It was more than facing death.	It was knowing that he was gonna leave behind nothing.
And so that's how this all started.	For better or worse he wanted to provide.
Yeah, I thought so too.	The truth is he never took their money.
Was that some sort of cover? - No, no.	He did not fake that, Marie.
He couldn't live with it.	He was suicidal.
No more gambling.	But we have the money.
How much money? Walt? Well it's into seven figures.	Holy Mary, mother of God.
What can I say? I did very well.	Marie you will take our money.
Marie, let us help.	Does Walt, Jr.
Know about this? - Absolutely not.	And I need to keep it that way.
Yeah, I Yeah, I just I need to Yeah, okay.	We'll talk about it later.
And I'm not forgetting that.	Surprised he doesn't make us do that.
The pack totally has a pecking order.	And the head hyena, he's the man, you know.
All the other ones have to, like, kiss his ass.	I mean, literally.
It's so gross.	They have to lick his junk.
And water boys, you know? Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.	Get us a couple flunkies in here.
Treat us right.	Okay, 15 hours starts now.
I'm gonna hit it, if that's cool with you.	I don't understand.
Dude's totally boning us.	No, it's not that.
Nothing gets spilled.	A little maybe.
Nothing gets spilled.	What about evaporation? It wouldn't account for this much.
Yeah, why? Nothing.	Are you coming? Yeah, in a minute.
Son of a Come on, you Come on, come on.	Son of a Come on.
Shut the door! - My ears are popping.	Shut the door.
What the hell's doing that? Positive pressure.	Positive what? God, it frigging kill,
Well, just move your jaw around.	I am moving it around.
It's not working.	Just yawn or something.
What positive? Positive what? Pressure.	I've turned the ventilation up to keep the outside out.
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa.	Hey, hold up.
Something got into the lab.	So, what do we do? I mean, do we? Wait.
So it's, like, not dangerous? Mr.	White, talk to me here.
Not to us particularly, no.	What the hell is that? This is I made it.
I'm trying to get it out.	Okay? Understand? No, man, not really.
It's a problem.	It's a contamination.
"Clear the contaminant.	" We're making meth here, all right? Not space shuttles.
But you are right.	We're running out of time.
We probably have the most un-picky customers in the world.	No, no, no.
No harm done.	Then we're golden.
It stays closed.	That's an order.
What does it matter? Who cares? I got it.	Oh, Jesus, seriously? - Where is it? It's right there.
See? I told you I got it.	This is a raisin.
Look, I definitely got it, man, all ri Oh, man.	He's got some kill,
Failing that we're dead.	There is no more room for error.
Then come back down here and subtract his ass.	Oh, wait, do you have your keys? - Yeah.
It's a real one.	Yeah, like yours was working.
No, no, no.	Look, we're trying to decontaminate.
I got a butt-Ioad.	We hang them up all over the place.
It won't be able to resist.	I sure hope we have enough.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say yeah.	Do you see him?
How long do you think you've been awake?	Why do you keep asking me that?
How about it? Yeah.	You take cream and sugar? - Black is fine.
It was a possum.	Big freaky-Iooking bitch.
I mean, why they gotta go changing everything? Whatever.	It's just big rats anyways.
Giant pink-tailed rats with their pink rat faces.	Totally freaky, like alien rats.
That's what they do.	I mean, they play dead or whatever.
It was Scrabble.	Yeah, that was it.
" She got like that toward the end.	Got obsessive about stuff.
Just got mad about stuff.	We didn't know what was up.
You know, got her some treatment.	Meds, so she wasn't stressing all the time.
It was a lot better after that.	You know, she was a lot happier.
And plus, my daughter wasn't born yet.	It had to be after Holly was born.
I mean, how could I possibly? I know the moment.	It was the night Jane died.
But afterward, I stopped at a bar.	It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.	I just walked in, sat down.
He's a complete stranger.	But he turns out to be Jane's father, Donald Margolis.
I mean, think of the odds.	Once I tried to calculate them, but they're astronomical.
"Never give up on family.	" And I didn't.
I took his advice.	The universe is random.
It's not inevitable.	It's simple chaos.
It's subatomic particles in endless aimless collision.	That's what science teaches us.
It was some Some nature programme about elephants.	And Skyler and Holly were in another room.
I could hear them on the baby monitor.	She was singing a lullaby.
Must be Thailand-hot up there.	That's why he likes it.
Thailand's hot, right? Yeah.	Then that's why.
It's not your fault.	It's not mine either.
It's no one's fault, not even hers.	You know, we are who we are, Mr.
I'm so close.	Let it go.
We need to cook.	What about the contamination? It's all contaminated.
All right, well I definitely scared him.	Probably stay out of our way.
Yeah! Somebody got got, yo! Did you see that, Mr.	Wh? Bins are packed? Bins are packed.
How's the yield? Two-oh-two and change.	You okay getting home? Yeah.
Jesse, come here.	I couldn't chance saying it inside.
For all I know, the lab's wired for sound.	That half a pound I said we were off by.
Who's asking you to?	Yo, I thought I was gonna see some, like, vaginas.
I didn't say she actually painted vaginas.	I said, some of her paintings looked like vaginas.
Seriously? Not even close.	Georgia O'Keeffe painted all kinds of stuff.
Everyday items, her surroundings.	Some of it evoked an erotic nature.
It's who she was.	Not like any vagina I ever saw.
It was the same subject, but different every time.	The light was different, her mood was different.
That door was her home and she loved it.	To me, that's about making that feeling last.
All right, here we go.	You ready? Come on, give me a step.
Nope, that's it.	Take me up.
You can do this, Hank.	Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
Pain is weakness leaving your body.	Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.
Lf you can get your leg up, go for it.	Take me up.
Never mind about your coffee break.	Take me up.
We'll just pick up where we left off.	Come on, Hank.
It's all right.	I'll be right back, okay? Be right back.
Just say the words.	You think I'm stealing.
Say whatever's on your mind.	How about you? You wanna start us off? Yeah.
One teenth? That's it? - Yeah.	To who? To him.
It's not easy selling to these people.	They're trying to better themselves.
You know what? I want it back.	All of it.
I'll sell it myself.	Come on, man.
It's not so easy like you think.	I will show you exactly how easy it is.
See you next week.	Oh, hey, sorry.
No, go ahead.	Andrea, right? - Yeah.
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner? No.	Your dad is.
Hey, so check it out.	See what that means? Check out the date.
You don't turn 16 for two more months.	It doesn't matter, it's a provisional.
Look it up.	They changed the law like, 10 years ago.
Yeah, well, I didn't vote for that.	Doesn't matter if you voted for it, it's the law.
I'll write that down so we don't forget.	Oh, darn it, no pencil.
It's a lovely name.	Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.
That's a joke.	That's a joke.
It funny because you are so clearly very classy.	Here, please, sit down.
Like I said, I got nothing here.	What if I could get some? - Mommy, Mommy.
I did, but we changed the time.	Grandma, this is Jesse.
He's from the meeting.	He's like a sponsor.
Jesse, this is Grandma.	Jesse, this is Brock.
Brock is almost 6.	You okay, with kids? What? Yeah.
He's gonna go play with his Legos and his cars.	Say, "Bye, Jesse".
My involvement in this is ongoing.	Understand? I can't just quit.
I have something of a contract.	But it's all very safe, professional.
It's a business you understand.	It's a story people will believe.
Not laser tag, this.	This is what we buy.
Yeah, I mean, there's free donuts.	Nothing's wrong with a free donut.
Hey, you know what? I have magical powers.	You wanna see? Ready? That's not real.
Do it again.	Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.
Come on, eat your food, Brock.	Can I have a chip? I'm gonna steal your chip.
All due respect, I don't see it.	So I vote no.
What? You know, that blue stuff you were talking about.	Maybe you had a line on some? - Wait.
What? Thought you said the kid is coming home.	Yeah, in a few hours.
It's not what I want.	Look, I was out of line talking about that stuff.
We both were.	You're right I don't know what you've been through.
You can tell me if you want.	This whole neighbourhood's run by gangs.
They run the drugs, control the streets.	They sort of took Tomas in.
No dad around.	Eight years old they got Tomas slinging.
I heard the rumours.	I didn't believe it at first.
But then I saw him like a week later.	And he told me, yeah, he did it.
They gave Tomas a	Gave him a choice.
Him or some dude.	So he did it.
Told me all about it like it was nothing.	Who did he say he kill? Some
From some outside crew.	Right around the corner from here, over off of Central.
Just because he was working the wrong corner.	It won't happen again.
I'm not leaving here till I'm well.	Hank, this isn't about insurance.
Hank, you get stronger every day.	You don't need to be in a hospital.
Wait till you see the bedroom.	I had them move the plasma in.
You get that out of my house.	You hear me, Marie? Today.
If we're looking for someone trustworthy.	What about me? What about you? Me.
No, no, Skyler, that is not a good idea.	I'm capable of managing a small business.
A legal business, not this.	Who else could we trust? - No.
Walt I'm in this.	And if I'm in it, I'm gonna do it right.
Married couples can't be compelled to testify against one another.	So there's that.
Yeah, I'll be there.	What was that? An invitation.
Walter, you're right on time.	Please, come in.
I hope you like paila marina.	It's a fancy name for fish stew.
I mean, this stew is simply an amalgam of ingredients.	Taken separately, these ingredients alone don't remind me of anything.
That's very interesting.	Walter I would like to help you, if I could.
And one must learn to be rich.	To be poor, anyone can manage.
You think you could hook me up? - Three hundred.	For a teenth? Shit, come on, yo.
You're a sweet girl.	Yes, you are.
Here you go.	Here you go.
30? - I'll be here with bells on.	What? It's just a saying.
Do you have a minute? - Yeah.	Could you keep an eye on your sister? - Sure.
"I never thought about it, officers.	Made sense to me".
Then again, he'd try anything.	I'm just not buying it.
Maybe if he were back sleeping in his own bed.	And suddenly a fantasy story.
Not every night, no.	Six nights a week.
One night off.	Dinner two nights.
I am going to be a part of this family.	That is how we'll sell your little fiction.
Yes, it's ours.	Now put it away.
Which means they work for our guy.	Right? What? No.
These two scumbags, they got him dealing.	They got him And you know he's not the first.
They use kids because hey, why not? Easy to control.	Easy to fool.
These guys kill	They used this little kid like some puppet.
How? - I need ricin.	Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.	Look, these two - Hey.
The delivery method, everything.	All I need from you is the poison, that's all.
No - Look.	Otherwise, you don't gotta lift a finger.
Well, I know I would be in prison after this.	Prison or worse.
And I'd be right alongside you.	No, Jesse, you cannot be serious.
That's what you said.	Untraceable back to us.
These guys don't.	Apples and oranges.
Now, murder is not part of your 12-step	This is not some amends that you have to make.
What you are talking about here is pointless.	This achieves nothing.
Jesse, listen to me.	You are not a
I'm not, and you're not.	It's as simple as that.
Chrissakes, Marie, you don't say "knock, knock," you like that.	I like saying it.
Well, that's not the rules.	Okay? - You knock your way, I'll knock mine.
But look, see? I win.	Not so fast.
Why? How is your old man? Back teaching? No.	I don't think either of them are working right now.
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.	Why not? What? That's what they said.
Why didn't you tell me? Let's wait then.	That's a joke.
The kid ain't coming.	Okay, so, what's plan B? - I don't know.
I really don't.	Well, let's brainstorm.
Or try, at least.	Okay, so we pay him off.
No, no, it's not about money.	It's about getting him off the streets.
Just some minor offence.	Pinkman in jail? I don't know.
I do all kinds of things for him.	Okay, so these guys are using kids like that.
Here we go.	Here we go.
Why? - Because it's moronic.	Saul said you've done things like this before.
No one knows I'm here.	Understand? But our employer would find out, like always.
I'd get called on domestic disputes all the time.	Hundreds, probably, over the years.
Wrists like little branches.	"Come on, tonight's the night we press charges.
This girl was scared.	She wasn't gonna cross him.
Swearing to God he's gonna leave her alone.	Screaming, much as you can with a gun in your
Just trying to do the right thing.	But two weeks later he kill
I'll never make that mistake again.	No more half measures, Walter.
Man, I don't get this.	I don't get this at all.
All I'm seeing is the kid.	So where are they? I don't know.
They're always around.	Burgers are getting cold.
So is it, like, fast? Don't sweat it.	You're just doing what you do.
Take a walk.	Where we going? Sit down.
It is possible they acted rashly.	But, on the other hand, there was provocation.
The man was selling on their territory.	There is blame on both sides.
This will go no further.	It will be settled right here, right now.
You told him? Wait outside.	Listen to me.
You don't look at him.	You look at me.
What are you doing? I'm just seeing.	Seeing what? - Seeing what I see.
Nothing's gonna happen.	I say it will.
You got one minute.	One minute? - Yeah.
It's just - It's pathetic.	That's good, keep talking.
Marie, give up.	I mean, seriously, it's not gonna happen.
Bad day? I don't even know.	Anyway it's better now.
Tell them you're busy.	Hello? Grandma? Slow down.
Hey, it's me.	Wait for the thing.
Jesse, you are now 42 minutes late.	I'm starting without you.
What is "wasabi"? - Wasabi.	Right you are.
What is "solo"? - This guy's good.	Four letter word, 2000.
"A loud, harsh cry; Walt Whitman's was barbaric.	" - "Yell.
" - What is "yawp"? - Kevin.	What is "yawp"? - Yawp.
I'll be right back.	That's what I said.
Okay to use your bathroom, right? Yeah, okay.	Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.	Hey, it's me.
Anyway, just call me back.	So the TV turns itself off, huh? - Yeah.
I'll get it.	The beginning of an early cold snap.
Nice to meet you.	Sandia Laboratories, huh? Yeah.
All right, that's a deal.	So this is it, honey.
He's actually a nice guy.	He doesn't push.
And this is the dining area.	Ah, the dining area.
Oh, and, uh-- It's got a pool.	Oh, pool is nice.
At least higher than here.	Walt, this is a good neighborhood.
I need my sleep.	You said no half measures.
You get your car fixed? Not yet.	You're gonna want to get your car fixed.
Where is Pinkman now? I wouldn't know.	A couple of time zones away, at least.
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.	He has enough money to last forever.
He knows he needs to keep moving.	You'll never find him.
I don't know, Walt.	It's what I do, after all.
He's out of the picture.	I saved his life.
Option A-- you kill me right here and	Apparently, I have made that very easy for you.
But that is Option A.	What is Option B? I continue cooking.
You and I both forget about Pinkman.	We forget this ever happened.
You'd need a new assistant.	I could get right on that.
You're silly, Pop Pop.	Well, a little.
But he'd probably knock everything over.	Plus, there's that big nose of his.
That's not a nose.	That's a horn.
I learn all kinds of things being with you.	Okay, June Bug, these are for you.
What about the rest? The rest are for me.	No, they're not.
You're too old for balloons.	Oh, you're never too old for balloons.
Give me a hug.	Oh, I see your mama.
Don't keep her waiting.	Bye, Pop Pop.
They keep me prisoner.	They keep you prisoner.
I don't do nothing for them ever.	They try and make me.
I say no.	They steal my chemicals.
I can't stop them.	I am businessman.
How's her driving? Driving.	Is she good behind the wheel? Good.
She's good driver.	Licensed? Dependable? She has a Camry.
I strongly recommend that you return our calls next time.	So have her drive you to the hospital.
She's gonna need her shoe.	Where did they cross? Laredo, looks like.
They didn't exactly send their A players.	But like you said, it's cartel, all right.
Well, they didn't find any.	What about Pinkman? I'm making inquiries.
Let's close it up.	Bring it down.
Does that guy ever leave? Nah.	When exactly did that start? It's new.
From here on out.	So, uh please teach me.
This is, uh-- I should have called first.	I'm not interrupting anything, am I? No.
No, not at all.	Please come in.
Can I offer you something? Cr�me de Menthe? Oh, no.	No, thank you.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.	Oh, no, no.
He's a very private person.	What exactly are his health problems? He's dying of cancer.
How would one track him down? I wonder.	You're still here.
I need your full attention, Saul.	Jesse Pinkman current whereabouts.
" Let me tell you something, Mike-- Whoa.	You are good right there.
Mike, uh, there are rules to this lawyer thing.	Is that right? Yeah.
So don't make me brat you till your legs don't	Now tell me where to find him.
You know it's the right thing.	I can't tell you, Mike.
I'm gonna leave the room, make myself a Nescaf�.	I'm just looking out for you, that's all.
Like a mother hen.	Believe me, money laundering ain't what it used to be.
God, do I miss the '80s.	Wasting your time.
I'm buying the car wash.	End of story.
Plus you get to shoot at	You got your bumper cars over there down that way.
Got your arcade right here.	All the latest video games.
Snack bar is over there.	Nothing stopping you from selling beer to the parents.
That's a whole new revenue stream.	All right, enough.
Over and above.	Service-wise, is is over and above.
And that goes double for you, Hip-Hop.	My guy's no dummy.
Make it snappy.	I'll go see if they have Tetris or something.
I mean-- I'll make it.	We had a-- We had a good run.
But it's over.	Never the DEA.
The cook can't stop.	That's the one thing I'm certain of.
Production cannot stop.	Gus can't afford to.
It keeps you alive, too.	I think I can see to that.
If I'm the only chemist that he's got.	I-- I can't do it, Mr.
I'll do it.	I'm gonna-- I'm gonna need your help.
Hell, I don't even know where the man lives.	He's not in the phone book.
I can't find him on the Internet.	I can't do it in the lab.
There's got to be some other way.	I'm all ears.
But I need you to track him.	Get me his address, and I'll do the rest.
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.	Are you gonna save mine? Yeah.
Anyone watching the place? No.	Looks pretty much wide open.
When are you gonna do it? Tonight.	Once it gets dark.
We got a problem.	Some kind of chemical leaking in your lab.
You gotta come with me.	I'll, uh-- I'll follow you.
They tell me to bring you, I bring you.	Come on, get in the car.
I'll cook-- I'll cook for free.	And there won't be any more trouble.
Please let me talk to him! Shut up! Shut up.	I can't do it.
Okay? Like you said, he's the problem.	He's always been the problem.
I'll take you right to him.	Huh? What do you say? Where is he? Right now.
You give me an address.	I-- I don't-- He moves.
I'll just-- It's just my phone.	I'll call him, and I'll have him meet me.
All right? Okay? Okay? Did you do it? Mr.	White? Did you do it? No, I didn't do it.
I can't now.	It's gonna have to be you.
What? No way, man.	Listen to me.
You're closer than we are.	You'll have about a 20-minute lead.
I have money.	I have-- I got a lot of money.
I have-- Um You-- Please don't do this.	You don't-- You-- You-- You don't have to do this.
I'm a manufacturer.	I'm not a dealer.
Grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.	You're my new lab assistant.
It's tens of thousands of dollars.	We have the money.
It comes down to you and me versus him.	I'm sorry, but it's gonna be him.
Why? Because your boss is gonna need me.	How's it coming? Very, very well.
It's a flurry of deliveries.	Feels like Christmas morning.
Ah, it's exciting.	It's really coming together.
Fring, I can guarantee you a purity of 96%.	I'm proud of that figure.
It's a tremendous gulf.	Gale, for our purposes 96% will do just fine.
A trained chemist, like yourself.	But it won't happen.
I don't consider him a professional.	If he's not, I don't know what that makes me.
I'm not trying to talk myself out of a job.	With this person, there are other considerations.
It's between Eubank and Spain but Mazatlan's closest.	I don't know.
Then it's straight residential.	You want me to what? Yeah.
You know him? We all heard this	Hey, I don't think you ought to go in there.
Mister, this is a crime scene.	You don't want to touch anything.
Drive! What the hell happened? He's gone? Look at me.	Gone? You sure? Gone? Splattered all over.
Oh, geez, I-- I-- I woke you up.	I woke you up.
I needed to get up anyway.	Are you coming in? No, no.
It's kind of my only time to run errands.	I just needed to-- I-- Sorry.
I'm not pressing.	I just-- I think that it's great.
That just might make him angrier.	Come on, Mike.
We're closed! Closed! Saul Goodman and Associates.	I'll see if he's in.
I called every number I have for him.	Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.
Look, Walter is fine, okay? I guarantee that 100%.	You got a passport, right? Yeah.
I need the number for a locksmith.	I don't know.
That would have your address.	No, but I can't even get in my car.
We could have been stabbed.	I'm sorry, really.
I can't believe this.	I cannot believe this day.
Oh, my God.	My identification -- It's gone.
Oh, God, not-- Not this second.	Call the pharmacy.
I-- Are you okay?	Please, just-- Please, just take her.
Here you go, sweetheart.	Oh, there you go.
So tell me all about it.	I heard you broke new ground today.
What? It's pretty.	I need the thing.
I know every step of his cook.	Do you really? You-- Really? So please tell me.
All his bullshit aside, it's called a cook.	See, everything comes down to following a recipe.
Simple, complicated, it doesn't matter.	The steps never change and I know every step.
Without-- Without Jesse and myself you have no new product.	You-- You-- You have no income.
Your people out there will not be paid.	Your distribution chain collapses.
Without us you have nothing.	You kill me, you have
You kill Jesse, you don't have	You won't do this.
You're too smart.	You can't afford to do this.
We're-- We're-- We're ready to go to work.	We'll just pick up right where we left off.
Oh, my God.	Well? Get back to work.
Let's just-- We'll just lay this down.	We'll put him in feet first.
I never used this stuff.	You sure it'll do the job? Trust us.
Here you go, hon.	Get you anything else? No, I'm good.
Golden, I would say.	We bought ourselves some time.
He'll be looking for another chemist.	He's not going to find another chemist.
Good luck with that.	Bet it took him years to find Gale.
Right as rain.	Do you have your keys? Yeah.
Wipe down this! I heard you broke new ground today.	I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes.
Yeah, I guess I broke new ground.	You worked here four years.
It's a story people would believe.	This is what we buy.
Assuming that's a deal breaker? Yes.	It's a deal breaker.
It's got plenty of stopping power.	Can't get more dependable than a wheel
Comes in polymer, too.	I prefer the feel of leather.
New sound system.	Whoa! Check it out.
Bodacious subwoofers, yo! Serious cannons.	six of them.
Aluminum columns so they're really, really like, uh, sonically neutral.	Tweeters are kill,
Hold on to your hats, bitches.	Hey, man, I saw Andrea at a meeting yesterday.
She asked about you.	Thanks, man, but, uh Seriously? Maybe just a little bump.
Resident Evil 4 takes it by a long	Aw, please, brother, you're fronting.
A dude don't need no more motivation.	That's a fair point, I guess.
Now, that's the bomb,	Think on it, bro.
Talibans-- They're the Talibans of the zombie world.	I played the game, bro.
You got to lead them and shit.	Dude, that's because they're not even zombies! They're just infected.
You know what this-- This place needs? Ohh.	You okay? Fine.
Can't you sleep? Actually, yes, Marie.	This is me sleeping.
24 in the morning.	This is not a rock.
Hey, uh, I'm going to work.	Wake up, bitch.
Aah! Damn! Ohh.	You're way too sensitive about your zone, bro.
The hell with, uh, with cleaning up.	Just go out and get everybody some breakfast.
Stock up on liquor while you're at it.	Keep this party going.
Come on, damn it.	Wake up and party! Hmm.
Oh, look who woke up hungry.	Are you hungry? Yeah, that's good.
Okay, my sweet girl? Mama's just doing her work here.	Mama's doing her work.
Whoa, way to soldier up.	You're doing it! Come on! Another few yards.
You're almost there, Hank.	Uhh! God! Ha ha ha ha! Oh, yeah.
All right, buddy.	That's what I call kicking some ass.
Same time tomorrow?	Damn straight, if I'm still alive.
It's just-- Yeah.	One day at a time.
Oh, my God.	Yo, what's up with the pie, man? It ain't cut.
That's the gimmick.	What gimmick? This place.
In man hours, that's-- I don't know.	A lot? Hey, Jesse.
So, uh, how you doing? I'm dealing.	How's Brock? Good.
We'll catch up later.	Guess you know I've been calling.
But you got to tell me one thing.	Is someone gonna come looking for this? No.
But I got to believe you won't do that.	Go home, Walter.
How you doing? Hi.	Ton of bricks? Rocks.
Did you check them for damage? Oh, my God.	They're rocks, Hank.
He cursed at me and grabbed himself.	And now he wants to buy my car wash.
Excuse me? Walter White wants to buy my car wash.	The price he pays is $20 million.
I get that completely.	And I harbor no ill will.
Well, there's a load off my mind.	Mike, I'm trying to tell you-- I get it.
Hell of a last couple of weeks.	Makes a man wonder exactly where he stands.
Not after what happened to Victor.	So what's with the piece? Right hip inside your waistband.
You done? Yeah.	Ohh! Oof! Ohh! Thanks for the drink.
So crash here.	It's not like I ain't got the space.
I ain't proud of it, but it's God's honest truth.	Hell, brother, you know we got man love for you.
Walt, I'm not leaving.	Oh, my god.
Why are you do-- Oh, Jesus.	What happened? Nothing.
And I didn't retaliate because he's a much older man.	And that's it.
So-- Frozen peas.	What? It's the best thing for the swelling.
Oh, it-- It-- It's not really swollen.	It's-- No peas.
You don't even have ice.	I will get peas.
I will get ice.	Peas and ice.
Charles? Hi, there.	Can I answer any questions? Yes.
Plank wood floors.	Central heat and air.
Any children? Yes.	As a matter of fact, a little boy.
He's a gemini.	Would love this yard.
Oh, well, great.	Not for religious reasons or anything.
The complete encyclopedia to fantasy football.	Look, it has all the latest rankings.
Well, you always thought this place could be bugged.	Now we know.
Yeah, well, I don't like it.	It's a violation of the work space.
Rain check? Yeah, sure.	How you doing? Good.
Two words-- Nail salon.	It's perfect for money laundering.
Go ahead, pinch yourself.	Ha ha ha! We're not buying a nail salon, Mr.
Can Huell use your bathroom? Huell? Uh, sure.	The top of the stairs.
He'll be quick.	It's a stomach thing.
Um, so the guy won't sell, he won't sell.	I don't accept that.
I don't accept that he won't sell.	I-- I think he just lacks the proper Motivation.
Ho ho ho ho! This one, she's a keeper.	Well, an audit can be highly motivating.
No, we don't want to draw any unwanted tax attention.	We don't want them looking at us after Bogdan sells.
raid? You know he's got illegals working over there.	I mean, he just has to.
" That angle.	What are you talking about? Violence? Attitude adjustment.
That is not at all what I meant.	I-- We do not do that.
I say it has to.	Why? I just do.
Aren't they something? One for each of the 50 states.	Uh, Puerto Rico is technically a territory.
It has all the information.	I'm Stephanie Doswell, by the way.
Any children? No.	I don't really want kids.
Uh, garbage disposal? Mm-hmm.	Aah! Check it out.
Well, thank you, Mimi.	It has a Very European feel.
I know you stole that spoon.	What spoon? What are you talking about? You're a thief.
Excuse me? And a liar, making stories up about yourself.	What's wrong with you? No.
You're not going anywhere.	Hey, my purse.
Just sit tight.	Where do they got you? So good news.
I won't, either.	Okay, then, so we're good to go.
Same as before.	But this is not right.
You cannot shut me down.	You cannot do this.
No, your soap is not the issue.	It's your filtration system.
Replace? Do you know how much cost that is? $200,000.	Look, I understand it's a hardship.
You hardly touched this.	I'm not hungry.
Well I'm leaving the rice pudding.	I'm not hungry, Marie.
How you doing? I-- I'm okay.	Is there a problem? No, no.
Hank will be thrilled.	Sweetie, you have a visitor.
How you doing? Oh, well, can't complain, you know.	Every day a little better.
Yeah, well, handsome was never the hard part.	Come on in.
Grab a seat.	Yeah, just throw that stuff anywhere.
Uh, it's cataloging them-- Sort them, label them.	Um, it's actually a lot of work.
No signs of forced entry, no signs of robbery.	Okay, so it's a crime of passion.
Want my advice? Take this to Steve Gomez.	He'll help you out.
That's what I do.	Well, it was a good try.
Here we go.	Time for your nap.
So Nail salon sounded promising.	What do you think? I think we wait.
It was a great idea.	But it didn't work.
Don't do that.	Why? - Don't do that.
I said he was unpleasant.	Ohh Well, he's not calling you back.
I mean, you didn't honestly think that worked.	Yeah, I do.
What? - No, just - Wait, wait.	What for? Wait, wait.
Right through the-- Right through the chain.	It's-- It's inevitable.
You see? I told you we'd get it.	Did you? Mm-hmm.
That's the hard part.	But yes, Saul was, uh Finally useful.
Oh, my God.	This is truly amazing.
Yes, well, it better be at $320 a bottle.	What? Cuv�e Pol Roget, Sir Winston Churchill.
I asked for an extension from the power company.	Why? Because on paper, we have no money.
I'm not asking you to apologize, Walt.	I'm asking you to be smart.
I bought one bottle of champagne, one single bottle, Skyler.	I paid cash.
All those in favor, raise your hand and say yes.	Yes is for the affirmative.
I made a copy for you in case you're interested.	It pertains to some methamphetamine superlab.
Actually that was Skyler's idea.	I think you are behind all this.
You guys are not lifting a finger.	I mean it.
Walt, you're not teaching them.	I thought you wanted me to be thorough.
Next decision is whether to double down or not.	What you should be doing.
Dealer has a 9.	I see that.
Um, we're not leaving anything to chance.	All right, let's get started.
We've got to be on the same page.	Is this a script? bullet
bullet points? Like a	This is smart.
This is Marie we're talking about here.	No, she hasn't.
Yes, we did.	It's just-- What? Never mind.
" Do you like that? Sure.	It accomplishes two things.
" Do you see that-- Yes.	Right there in the middle of the page? Okay.
Oh, and I put in that line about robbery.	You know, from the G.
Well, I just wouldn't use that word.	I would never say the word "terribly.
Let's just pick up where we left off.	I'm weak, and I'm out of control.
I mean, this whole thing makes me look like crap.	This has to be a warts-and-all story, Walt.
I don't want Junior thinking less of me.	At least you won at gambling.
I'm sorry that I put you through all of this.	How's that sound? Hmm? Here.
I don't know.	I'll just have to see what happens in the moment.
I'm doing the best I can here, Walt.	And yes, I'm thorough.
How you doing? Oh, look at my little princess.	She's getting big, huh? An heavy, too.
We're going to get things organized.	Yeah, it'll be about 10 minutes.
Let's go see it.	Oh, hey, let me.
Hey, it's all right.	I got it.
Come on, guys, it's down the hall here.	Now that one there, that's Rhodonite, okay? It's manganese inosilicate.
Whatever the hell he said.	Anyway, you, uh, you get the idea.
Yeah, it's, uh, interesting.	Interesting stuff, that.
You guys-- Seriously, you got to check this out.	This is good.
Ready? Here we go on here.	Look at this guy.
Man of hidden talents.	Dad, you're such a stud.
Same goes for me, you know.	If you ever want to bounce anything off me.
Yeah, he seems, uh, unique.	Here, let me-- Let me-- Let me show you something.
Give it-- Give it.	Right here at the, uh-- And here's the top.
I don't know.	God, I wanted to get this guy.
It looks like you did.	No, I mean, you know, me personally.
I guess somebody knows something.	They'll track down the shoot
No, I need to know specifics.	Now, we'll start from the beginning.
You-- You drove there.	You drove over there.
It's-- It's like Skid Row.	He has actual hobos living there.
I mean, Western Union-- Message received.	It-- Let me ask you.
I mean, off the grid.	New identities, new everything.
I mean, there's no coming back.	Sh-- You want his card? Ahh.
I can do that.	I can definitely do that.
Hey! Get some dipping sticks too, yo.	Uh, I can-- I can definitely get dipping sticks.
What's up? What's up with your ear? Downstairs now.	Where is everybody? I invited your guests to leave.
Know who this is? No.	You ought to.
Let yourselves out.	I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
How's the ear? Mending.	What can I do for you? It's Pinkman.
He's become increasingly incautious.	He's a risk, a liability.
Got to be kidding me.	Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.	All right, this is message number 3.
Hey, it's me.	Wait for the thing.
Wait for the thing.	Where is he? Going to ask where we're going? Nope.
Saul, shut up.	Shut up and listen to me.
Just make sure she gets everything.	All right? Just make it happen! Hi.
You've reached the White family.	Please leave a message.
Fring isn't here right now.	Is there something I'm able-- - He's here.
What's up? Jesse, w-where are you? With Mike.	I know you're with Mike.
But it doesn't-- Goodbye, Walter.	Mike-- Sir-- Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.	As I said, sir, Mr.
This freaking guy, I tell you what.	It's like Scarface had sex with Mister Rogers or something.
Who does this, you know? Your boy Heisenberg.	Thought we had him already.
The other one is, uh, Jesse Pinkman.	He and I have a history.
No, I know.	I get it, really.
Uhh Buh-buh-buh-buh- buh-buh-buh-buh.	It's finally hitting me what the-- The plan is here.
You're not capable of being the guy.	I had a guy, but now I don't.
You got it? Oh.	We having second thoughts? Every hour of every day.
Let me tell you, that is perfectly normal.	But your expectations are realistic.
You have a good, solid business plan.	I'm feeling very confident.
Thank you very much, Alan.	It is my pleasure.
Oh, well, we'll be looking for you.	I'll be there.
This is a big step, Walt.	If we don't do this right-- We'll be fine.
We will? Tell me again.	We will be fine.
There can't be any mistakes like before.	There has to be complete honesty.
I guess that merits a celebration.	Nothing too expensive.
Yeah, we can do that.	That'll-- That'll be nice.
Where are you? Uh, we're-- We're back here.	We'll be out in a minute.
Ohh He knows that you're here.	I'm parked in the driveway.
You think? I have to get back to work.	You know, schedule.
It's dangerous and counterproductive.	Jesse operates the forklift, not me.
I just-- I don't know.	Go ahead, kid.
Go grab a mug.	Milk? Sugar? Just black.
She-- She said that? Yeah.	Tuesday, is it? Huh.
But I know better than to ask.	Anyway, it was like you wanted.
I'm talking about your baby sister.	I wouldn't let you near my car.
Hey, that's not a bad idea, you guys.	You should put Holly on the sign.
The wipe-down crew would clean you up good.	See this, son? I got your wipe-down right here, pal.
And, uh, we get possession of the keys tomorrow.	Oh, that's awesome.
Right, uncle Hank? Squeaky and greasy.	That's you, my friend.
He was a famous big-time card player.	Hank, that's not funny.
What? It's a compliment.	Well, that's even worse, then.
Uh, he was a meth chef.	I mean, we're talking five stars-- Candles and white tablecloths.
He brought over some file boxes on that case.	Thought I'd take another peek.
You want me to make some coffee? Yeah.	Yeah, that would be good.
The kid's a hero.	It's a story people would believe.
This is what we buy.	To clean cars and clean money.
Gale Boetticher he was a genius.	I'm not sure I agree.
You needed it.	Ohh Skyler, I don't entirely remember what happened last night.
Did you know him? Ha.	Oh, my God.
I know exactly what happened last night.	I drank too much wine.
The firewall, all right? Church and state.	That's how we need to approach this thing.
After last night, I-- Walt, I think you're scared.	I think that message was some kind of goodbye.
I've said it before.	If you are in danger, we go to the police.
I do not say that lightly.	I know what it could do to this family.
You're in over your head.	That's what we tell them.
That's the truth.	That is not the truth.
Of course it is.	A schoolteacher, cancer, desperate for money? Okay, we're done here.
I am not in danger, Skyler.	I am the danger.
Ohh Look, I was-- Skyler? Here we are.	Just like you left it.
So here's everything you need.	I keep very good files.
Being in charge is not easy.	It takes hard work.
You've seen me work hard, Bogdan.	Yeah? I don't know.
A boss has to be tough.	Has to say no to people.
Both of them.	Uh-- I'm on my way.
You need any help? No.	You want me to call her back? No.
It-- It-- It's not like you're doing this on purpose.	You can't help it.
It's no that simple.	Look, you have a disease.
It-- It's like you're an alcoholic, right? No, it's not.	Not at all.
Yes, it is.	I read online.
Gambling addiction is a sickness.	You c-- - Listen.
I'm glad you like it.	I-- I do, Thank you, Dad.
I told you already.	We pick up money, check on things, stuff like that.
Everybody needs backup, right? And this has to be you.	It can't be I don't know.
You are such an	Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer.
Like you said, Gus can't kill you because of	He knows I won't stand for it.
If you'd been there, you'd know it wasn't a setup.	Wait a minute.
�S�? �S�? �Qu�? I need help to clean.	Yes, s�, �comprendes, s�? �Qu�? No, no, no.
Atr�s, atr�s, �s�? Muy bueno, muy bueno.	Yes, muy bueno.
It's just this-- - No.	No, no, no, no.
Es no problema.	Un momento, un momento, un momento.
Un momento, un momento.	Un momento, un momento.
Yo necesito ayuda, uh limpio dos horas m�ximo.	No, no podemos.
I'll tell you what.	I'll tell you what.
�Para usted? S�, s�, s�.	Para usted, s�.
Oh, your first attempt being such a wild success.	You may know this whole P.
What are you doing? Digging.	Why? Uh, you know why.
How deep are you going? I don't know.	How deep do you think it is? Pretty deep.
Hey, uh, mind if I use your john? Yeah.	Tucker! Tucker! Tucker! Who the hell are you? I-- Hey.
Trouble? Trouble? What does that mean, trouble? No, no.	I'm just saying we're cool, okay? We're-- We're-- We're good.
Ustedes, uh, residar �cerca aqu�? I missed that one.	I'm sure it was good.
Why? What bus? One that takes them back to Honduras.	Hey, wait a second.
Wait a minute.	Th-Th-This was my idea.
Don't punish them.	You tell Gus to blame me, not them.
So that's yours, huh? Yeah.	Dad got it for me.
It goes back tomorrow.	Skyler, it will crush him.
I just worry that he'll blame you for this.	Oh, he will.
Which they did.	"Ready to talk?" Jesse? What about you? No judgments.
Tim stopped by.	He brought over some file boxes on that case.
That car contradicts our story.	It goes back tomorrow.
Came out of nowhere.	You gotta help us.
Look at all this damn water.	Don't drink that.
Ain't no telling what's gonna be poison.	How's Junior? Oh, exactly what I expected.
They didn't want to take it.	What? It's in perfect condition.
Call me if there's a problem.	And please, just don't- don't tangle with anyone.
I need a cab.	Yes, thank you.
The name is White.	Uh, I'm at the Pavilion parking lot on University.
Oh, yes, that's right.	Just south of the airport.
Oh, how long do you think that would take.	No, I'm sure he'll see me.
That means your record stays clean.	The wife never finds out.
I've been working magic here.	I can at least get an "attaboy.
And we're sure about this.	'Cause Pinkman ss he needs you too much.
" Unless you could help me find a third party.	What third party? Someone who can ameliorate the situation.
" All I would need is a phone number.	I would do the rest.
Saul, there'd be a finder's fee.	A big one.
He's still scared the dude's gonna come break his legs.	So I give him the latest.
I'll do it.	You'll do what? I'll kill him first chance I
He's got a long way to go, but he- Yeah.	I mean- - Oh, hey.
Give or take.	Give or take? - Yeah.
I haven't counted it.	Wait And this is how often? Every two weeks.
That could take years.	So set some aside.
I just didn't expect this amount of money.	The 50s are gonna be a problem.
Well, that's what this is- Problem solving.	Skyler, this is a simple division of labor.
I bring in the money, you launder the money.	This is what you wanted.
I never wanted any of this.	I've got to go.
Keep it with you.	When you have the opportunity, be ready.
Could use the exercise.	Get he blood pumping.
Don't worry, you're not gonna have to pick me up.	It might take me a while, but I'll get there.
Jesus, ain't we a pair? You must really like chicken.	V-8, 470 horses, satellite radio, Bluetooth, Whoa.
Good to see you.	Walter Junior, do you remember Mr.
Fring? - How are you? - Well.	Nice to see you again.
It's a pleasure to see you here.	You're looking very well.
Uh, I don't know about this one.	He might eat up all your profits.
Take a Diet Coke.	Thank you very much.
The order of the day is eyes open, mouth shut.	S'up? Test, test.
You know how to make coffee? Sure.	There you go.
I don't have an extra holster.	You stick this in your pocket.
Keep it out of sight.	If you're gonna be here today, you're gonna have a
A lot of	Nobody's asking you to give up yours.
You got something of mine? Glove box.	Figure I better teach you how to
Long time, no see.	How you doing? Yeah, you know, uh good.
"I'm such an asshhole.	" "It's totally hopeless.
He- He was just scared, and then he was gone.	He was suffering.
It was a kindness.	No, he wasn't sick.
On the bottom, right- right there.	It's been a week.
Hey-hey-hey, buddy! - Hey.	Look at that.
Graduated to doorman.	Finally found your calling.
Oh, thanks, Steve.	Good to see you.
How you doing? - He's doing fine.	We, uh, we can take it from here.
Right, Gomie? - Yeah.	If you want to hold his elbow.
No, no, no, no.	You keep your mitts off me.
Maybe he's got the connections, too.	Maybe, just maybe he's our guy.
Please I fear for my family.	I'm sure they'll be fine.
I am told the assassin that survived is gravely injured.	It's doubtful he'll live.
Now thank me and shake my hand.	Uh, thank you.
Thank you again.	You're quite welcome, Mr.
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.	One suspected gun died at the
I can give you highlights.	Your nephews grew impatient.
This is what comes of blood for blood, Hector.	Sangre por sangre.
This is the PET/CT scan.	Positron emission tomography.
I'm still pretty new at this.	I mean, one minute I'm starting a new business.
Excuse me? Never give up control.	Live life on your own terms.
It's what they keep telling me.	Well, guess what.
But until then, who's in charge? Me.	That's how I live my life.
How's Kathi? Much better, thank you.	And you know Hank Schrader.
Ah, yes, indeed.	And Steve Gomez.
Well, should we get started? Yeah.	I'd like to record this conversation, if that's okay.
But then again I have no idea why I'm here.	So you wish to continue? Please.
Really? That's surprising.	A drug-related homicide.
Gale Boetticher's apartment.	So you knew the victim.
Gale was a recipient of this scholarship.	He was, uh, perhaps one of three dozen.
Drug related, you said? It's a good possibility.	The paper made no mention of that.
I was there from 7 to about 10.	Anyone else? Uh, sorry, yeah.
Well, really, it isn't.	General Pinochet's government was guilty of a great many sins.
First and foremost were his human rights abuses.	But it was also notoriously unreliable at keeping records.
I think that's it, Gus.	Uh, thank you.
I hope that I was of some small help.	You were, absolutely.
Well, I agree.	I think it was a good story.
You kidding me? That's a great deal.	Uh, speaking of which, ahem.
Hey, champ, how's the new school? Good.	I loved school when I was your age.
You got it.	So is he-- How's he doing? Jesse? He's good.
He's, uh he's busy.	How is it? Oh, there's space, lots of light.
I guess I am.	Actually, I'm thinking about making a move up to management.
Corporate America, look out.	Oh, excuse me.
Just a dead end.	He won't tell me, either.
I mean, nothing fancy.	Just entry-level beryls and garnets, one passable black tourmaline.
Yeah, the-- the Fun Run guy.	Yeah, that-- that guy-- Yeah.
It made me keep at it.	And guess what I find.
I mean, he's got reasons for everything.	This guy is Terms of Endearment convincing.
Something deep down says he's my guy.	Just got to prove it.
You stick this on the car.	This part right here? It's a magnet.
It's our little secret.	Look, it's easy, okay? Here's what you do.
Where's my soda? Just kidding.	Let's-- Let's go.
I will make sure that he discovers nothing.	Jesse! What? All right.
Ah, yeah, yeah, I got it.	Your brother-in-law, okay? I'm thinking.
He's relentless, all right? He won't quit.	Yeah, well, he's got nothing is all I can say.
Okay? Hank already knows who you are, by the way.	And besides, you actually did kill Gale, so there's
Well, then insist on it, damn it! Act panicked.	Gus' ass is on the line, And trust me.
You know what? Whatever, man.	I'm going to take a piss.
Uh, I think you got a phone call.	Anything important? Yes? I did some digging around.
DEA agent Schrader-- uh, he's a concern.	He's looking into my past.
Is today the day, Hector? Si.	Look at me, Hector.
Look at me.	Maybe next time.
I got it, I got it.	Just-- You're like a bee at a damn picnic, Marie.
We'll use the drive-through.	All right, baby.
Let's see what we got.	What the hell? Look at this.
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.	That's work, that's home, that's work, that's home.
Thank you so much.	If you would, I would appreciate it.
What do you do after work? Go home, watch TV.	What do you watch? I don't know.
Ice Road Truckers.	What happens on that one? Guys drive on ice.
I am going to do it.	You got to inhale, by the way.
But no more than five years old.	Air bags, safety rated, all that.
Uh It's not far from town.	The place is huge.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.	Sounds promising, right? Huh.
Um I mean, it sounds great.	It really does.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	I get it.
Hey, don't be.	I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.	I'll find another ride for this one.
Another ride? Yeah.	I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.	Maybe I'll ask him.
Look, I'm-- I'm-- This is probably just a 24-hour thing.	Maybe 48 hours, at the most.
Oh, and SUVs are extra.	And please give this to your car care professional.
Well, uh Hello.	You look great.
Not at all.	You look happy.
It most certainly is.	Look, here's the thing.
The damage is already-- My name.	My signatures are all over those books.
I can't have this in my life.	I cannot be audited.
He'd never cook for Gus again.	Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
Son of a bitch!	You get comfortable, kid.
Get down! S�.	Should I even ask? - I wouldn't.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.	Just get the barrel.
His distribution network.	They're not looking to kill
You got questions, ask him yourself.	And here again.
That's why we're here.	Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company.	But it's not all accounted for in your reports.
How gross income for a business is defined.	You're not allowed to do that.
Well, I think I am.	No, you're not.
Got a good instinct for them.	Right, Teddy? Right.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.	I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
What happened is good news.	Ignorance of the law does not equate to criminality.
Just put it behind you.	Pay with what? I owe them $617,000.
What am I-- - Look, just figure it out.	All right? You just dodged prison.
Take a mortgage? I have a lien on my house.	I don't have any assets.
You have to settle.	Wish I could.
We'll eat first.	And then we'll talk.
And I will explain everything that's happening.	I will answer your questions.
Can you produce this product? Without any help, alone? No.	Why? You asking me if I can cook Mr.
That is not what I asked you.	You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.	I need you to help prevent an all-out
Now, if you would, answer the question.	Hey, you, uh-- You headed out? Yeah.
So you saw Gus? What? No.	You didn't see Gus.
They-- So "they" doesn't include Gus.	You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.	You haven't spoken to Gus.
Why are you You weren't at Gus's house last night.	What? What the hell? J-Jesus-- It's still here.
I cannot be audited.	Circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.	No one needs to go to Mexico.
The cartel wants your formula.	Now get the fuck out of here and never come
You can do this.	You have reached Walter White.
I-- I don't really understand why I'm here.	Is it something to do with my creditors? Creditors? No.
Beneke, I have some bad news.	Uh nothing but, lately.
That's how I know how to do it.	What is he saying? We're working it out.
So you understand what asshole	Now, go get me my phenylacetic acid,
Several hours at least.	I can wait.
Are you okay? I know you're home.	Your car is here.
I don't know what else to do.	Dad?  Come in if you're coming in.
Don't do that.	Look, I-- I appreciate that you're concerned.
And it's my own fault.	I had it coming.
Dad, it's okay.	It's all my fault.
Dad, it's okay.	Hey-- Hey-- It's okay.
Please, it's-- it's okay.	Look at me.
Hey, how was your birthday? Good.	Get some rest.
Yeah? What's that mean?	You're staying. You belong to the cartel now.
Yeah, I can't believe he actually bought it-- "Great-aunt Birgit.	" What? But you called it.
If you would, note the time on that.	Three hours after leaving my office.
He bought a Mercedes SL550.	He's actually leasing it, but he put 4,500 down.
I called her last night.	I told her I was spending the night at Louis'.
I wish I could take back last night.	It was your birthday.
My father died when I was 6.	You knew that, right? Yeah.
She would talk about him all the time.	I knew about his personality, how he treated people.
I knew things about my father.	I had a lot of information.
Oh, there was this stench of Lysol and bleach.	You could just feel it coating your lungs.
Anyway, there, lying on the bed, is my father.	He's all-- He's all twisted up.
At least last night you were-- you were real.	You know? Bye.
Okay? Yeah, thanks, Tanya.	Okay, you bet.
Oh, thank you.	That's-- gosh, that's-- that's wow.
Guess someone's looking out for me.	I guess so.
Is that yours outside? Oh, yeah, you know.	Can't be driving a piece of crap to customer meetings.
You've got to present that successful image.	Yeah, right, right.
So the IRS stuff-- that's resolved? Yeah, it's in progress.	So you paid them? Well, not yet, but I will.
When? Well, it's not that simple.	Um, here's the thing.
No, it doesn't.	I'm telling you, you need to drop this.
This is your new employer.	You address him as Don Eladio.
Welcome to Mexico.	Now you say "Muchas gracias a usted, se�or.
Are you still with us?  Go.	Get us out of here, kid.
Do you understand? I quit.	I just told you.
I'm just curious what the next move is.	Our next three moves is sitting here and waiting.
Yeah, well, not a lot happening Stateside.	I'm hearing rumblings about some big play down south.
Lots of bodies, apparently,  even by cartel standards.	We'll know more when the buzzards leave the bones.
Dumb Okie bastard.	Had his car repo'd playing scratch-n-wins.
He's fine now, you know.	He got help and all.
How do you know all that?  Jesus.	He thought of everything.
It's time to go.	What about Mike? With his injury? No.
Unfortunately, only one way north.	Six miles to Texas.
You gonna make it? Six miles is pretty far.	I'll make it.
You did well down here.	And you also proved a point.
I think you can run the lab by yourself now.	Don't you? Let Mr.
Come on in.	First, I want to tell you that I get it.
It feels wrong.	It feels wrong? - To me, it does.
No one's going to prison.	Oh, my God.
Let's say I take your advice.	I pay the IRS.
But I still owe the bank, Skyler.	I'm still gonna go bankrupt.
I'll lose my business and my home.	I still have to pull my girls out of school.
Don't twist my words.	This isn't about amounts.
This is about me doing the right thing.	Ted, are you blackmailing me? - What? No.
I don't want you to pay me, Ted.	I want you to pay them.
But, Skyl-- Try it again.	Write a new check.
Saul Goodman, please.	Tell him it's important.
It was just you and Joaquin.	He was the only family you had left.
Now the Salamanca name dies with you.	Will you look at me now? Look at me, Hector.
It's not far.	Just turn right here.
Sounds like a real shit in the dark	I mean, you said it yourself.
Well, look at you.	You lose your hair, you go on a couple stakeouts.
Just turn in there.	Well, slow down.
You gotta turn there, Walt.	Walt, what are you doing? You just missed it.
I thought you meant further up.	Just bang a U-ie over here.
Frozen yogurt does taste the same.	Tastes exactly the same.
Weigh in here, Uncle Hank.	Hey, it's free food.
Free food always tastes good.	Free drinks even better.
Anyway, hanging in there.	Glad you stopped by.
Listen, I'm-- I'm sorry about all this.	That guy-- he just came out of nowhere.
Yeah, actually, he didn't.	I saw him coming a mile away.
Your Hardy Boys routine is over.	No more asking him to drive you on stakeouts.
It's too dangerous.	You hear me? - I'll do it.
It was a bit shortsighted of me.	That's why I caved.
Caved? I broke down.	I ordered me a gimp-mobile.
It's a regular Tahoe.	It's got hand controls.
I ordered it.	It should be here in about a week.
Car wash business.	Hey, it's me.
He doesn't own a	At least not one that he bought legally.
It's gonna be fine.	I've got my A-team on it.
Huell? Who's Huell? This is Huell.	Huell, you happy? Reasonably.
Beneke wouldn't care for that? I'm gonna say no.	Well, there you have it.
Let's go find your checkbook.	Ready? Here we go.
So, the amount's gonna be for $617,226-- Whoa, whoa.	I don't have anywhere near that kind of money.
Phone-call time is over.	This is check-writing time.
This is crazy.	Skyler would never do this to me.
Sit down and write! There you go.	$617,226 and 31 Yeah.
Everything else has been filled out for you.	All's we need is a signature right there.
Here's what happens next.	Huell's gonna hang here with you.
Someone cooked here.	You've been out of commission four days.
Look at-- - Ooh, yeah.	- 101 backflips I did.
Oh, you're in trouble.	Mama's in the house.
We need to talk.	I got nothing to say to you, man.
Just one minute.	That's all I ask.
Stay away from Pinkman.	Do not go near him.
But he'll come around.	In the meantime, there's the matter of your brother-in-law.
He is a problem you promised to resolve.	You have failed.
I will kill your	I will kill your
Perfect, you know.	This is just I told her you were my A-team.
It was an act of God.	Ain't no accounting for no act of God.
Check's in the mail, at least.	Oh, hello, Mrs.
I need this man now.	Saul! Now, Saul! Yeah, yeah.
You're a high-risk client.	You're gonna need the deluxe service.
But you got four people to vanish.	It's gonna be at least half a million.
And he accepts cash only.	I've got the money.
Now come on.	Please! - Here.
But you gotta bring the money.	He doesn't lift a finger unless he's paid in full.
They know me.	They know my voice.
They'll know me.	Please, you gotta do it for me.
My brother-in-law doesn't deserve to die because of this.	There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.
They're coming back to finish the job that they botched.	You say whatever you have to say.
No, no, no, no.	Where's the rest? That's not enough.
For us, for the family.	I swear, Walt.
You've reached the White family.	Please leave a message.
It's happening again.	The DEA called.
You know that won't work.	Then you've got a problem.
I've got nothing to say to you, man.	I will kill your
I will kill your	I will kill your infant
You're gonna get new social's, new identities.	It's gonna cost you.
I've got the money.	Now I need you to call the DEA.
Gus has a hit out on Hank.	Where is the money!? I gave it to Ted.
How many? - Four.	Nelson Brey, three others.
Skyler-- Skyler - What? - I'm not going.	What? I'm not going to Hank and Marie's.
I'm not going anywhere.	But you said we're in danger.
Yes, that's true.	Because of me.
I'm the real target.	But we'll all be safer at Hank's.
That's-- - No, no, no.	No one will be safe at Hank's if I'm there.
Walt, it's DEA.	Skyler, you don't know these people.
I-- - No, Skyler, please, trust me.	This is how it has to be.
You'll figure it out.	Hank knows that Marie will be overreacting.
Except she's not.	I'll talk to Hank.
All right, buddy, take care.	Shh, shh, shh, shh I know.
He's going to get his behind here immediately.	End of story.
Because we are all in danger here.	We are not all in danger.
Will you stop saying that? That is asking for trouble.	Oh, come on, Walt.
It's a perfect spot for a meth superlab.	Oh, my God.
Hey, I'm Steve Gomez.	I'm with the DEA, Drug Enforcement.
What, is there-- there a problem? Not for you.	No, no problem.
We're just wondering if we could take a look around.	I, uh-- Can I tell you a story? - Yeah.
I don't want to do this stuff with you.	I-I know, I know.
You don't have to say it.	I'll say it for you.
All right? Hope I made myself clear about that.	Call me as soon as you can.
I don't know if I'm speaking English here-- What's up?	He's waiting for me, yo.
Hold up, hold up.	The hell, man? Get off of me!
Hey, Goodman! Get out here! Get--  Hey!	Yo, get your goon off me.
Sorry, you can't be too careful these days.	Come on, come on.
Nothing, huh? Clean as a whistle, so he says.	You have reached Walter White.
It's me again.	I really wish you'd pick up.
He was fine this morning.	He was fine.
I'll be out here if you need me.	Go, go ahead.
No no Come on.	No! No, No.
Andrea! Andr-- Hey, hey, hey, no yelling.	Andrea-- I need-- - We can't have you back here.
No, I need to talk to her.	All right? I need to talk to her.
You two, just take this outside.	Would you please-- Brock is sick in here.
Come here-- Here.	Jesse Jesse, what is it? Jesse, I can't go.
What-- I'm-- I'm thinking Brock may have been poisoned.	Okay? What? There's this stuff, this stuff called ricin.
It sounds like "rice.	" You need to tell the doctors about it.
I'm sorr-- I gotta go.	Just tell them.
Let me in.	I don't know what you're thinking coming here.
All I know is it's going to happen.	And I'm powerless to stop him.
What else could I do? No.	No, you son of a bitch.
You know what you did.	Okay, look, just-- just put the gun
There's no way Brock took it himself.	Jesse, you're not thinking clearly.
What? - Yeah.	Yeah, I went to his office.
He called me and just had to see me today.	His big man-mountain bodyguard patted me down.
Just admit it.	Admit what you did.
Just listen to me.	Listen to me.
Listen to yourself.	No, he has known everything all along.
You are everything that he's wanted.	You're his cook now.
Do it! Do it.	I'll do it.
He'll see you coming.	You'll die before you get anywhere near him.
Oh, Jesus, Mr.	Pinkman, I'm not going to keep telling you.
Unless the family wants you in there, you're not allowed.	You can't keep coming in here like this.
You hear me? You understand? Mr.	Pinkman, I'm going to call Security.
All right, here we go.	Come on now.
I already told you.	I'm not going.
He'd like to speak with you.	I told you, I'm not leaving.
I can't be away.	I don't even want to be here now.
He was poisoned.	How did that happen? The doctors-- they don't know.
This current batch is surely ruined now.	Correct? Stay with the boy.
There you are.	There you are.
No, don't go.	Don't go, don't go, don't go.
Oh, sh No.	As is your grandson.
Gus! - I'm gonna kill	Then let me help.
Well, maybe-- Excuse me.	Jesse Pinkman? Uh, yeah.
Am I under arrest? No, you're not under arrest.	We're just talking.
Yeah, you know, like House or the Discovery Channel.	Sometimes your brain just makes these connections.
Look, I've got to get back.	But we're still talking.
So I'm not under arrest, but I can't leave.	So, then, I guess I should call my lawyer.
Right? I mean, you know.	You've been around the block, Jesse.
I need him right now.	So you break into the place.
Let me explain something to you.	My partner and I-- - Are in danger? Whoop-dee-freaking-doo.
Now, I apologize profusely.	Please, the phone number.
I'll be right back.	Yes, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Okay, I'll await your call.	Thank you so much.
That's a relief.	I owe you one, big time.
Tell us what you know.	I told you what I know.
He's a wordsmith.	Well, Detectives, it's been a pleasure.
Now, up you go.	Make like you've got manners.
Make like you respect the rule of law.	Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen, hasta luego, get the hell out.
Pick it up.	Follow your partner.
I've been thinking.	And? Casa Tranquila.
Old guy in a wheelchair.	Um, doesn't talk, rings a bell.
That's number 3 in your B column, followed by O-74.	That's O-74 on the other side of your card.
Now we have that lucky number-- B number 7.	Is it lucky for you? B-7.
Those Ns just keep coming.	They're all sticking together.
I am offering you an opportunity for revenge.	Column 4-8, the continental United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
Okay, I'm here.	How you doing this morning, Mr.

Help me out here.	Hey, son, what's up?
When exactly are you getting here?	Uh, just as soon as I can.
Let me talk to him.	No, son, I am taking it very seriously.
Walter? Did you hear what he said? Get over here.	No more excuses.
And thank you for all of your help.	Huh? Anything? - Hi, everyone.
Come here, look at this.	Jesus, enough with the laundry.
This place has two of them.	All right? That's a whole lot of juice, brother.
What do you say? Pop over, have another look-see? Listen.	I think we possibly have a lead on something.
Yeah? I have this guy down at the office.	He says he has some kind of information.
Why? Well, he's the guy.	His nurse calls us, says he wants to powwow.
That's all this is.	That's what we thought.
His nephew's gone.	Doesn't have anybody.
Hank, thanks for coming down.	No problem at all.
First letter-- S.	A-E-I-O-U-- Second letter-- U.
A-- B-C-- A-E-I-- J-K-- A-E-I-- J-K-L-M-- A-E-I-O-U-- Row U.	V-W-X-Y-- All right, that's enough.
I am-- I am-- I am just so, so sorry.	Well, at least this time he didn't shit himself.
We may have a problem.	I've got eyes on the DEA.
Why? What happened? Tox screen came back.	No ricin poisoning.
Surprised, huh? No, why should I be? Your jacket.	Till we meet again.
Hey, yo! Yo! Right here.	Hey, Andrea, I'm just checking on Brock.
No wires, no camera, no surveillance.	A police cruiser rolled through about an hour ago.
Maybe it's better if-- if I do this myself.	I do this.
What kind of man talks to the DEA? No man.	No man at all.
A crippled little rata.	What a reputation to leave behind.
You heard of that place.	We've got very few details on it so far, unfortunately.
Coming up on Coyote 102.	5-- Aerosmith, Def Leppard.
Keep it right here on New Mexico's finest rock.	You wanna cook with a broken arm? Next step, CO2.
We've got work to do.	Uh, he's going to pull through.
Oh, thank God.	You know, still saying it wasn't the ricin.
So Gus didn't poison him after all.	Still, he-- he had to go, right? You're damn right.
Gus had to go.	Um, you know, I should-- I should get back.
Jesus, Walt, the news here.	Gus Fring is dead.
Skyler White sent you? - Just checking writing times.	Brock how is he doing? He just keeps getting worse.
He's not safe.	He was poisoned.
It wasn't the ricine.	It was the lily of the valley.
What about Mike? With this injury? No travel.	We've got work to do.
Here you go.	What happened there? It's my birthday.
Yeah? Well, Happy Birthday.	Birthday meals are free at Denny's.
Free is good.	Even if I was, like, rich, free is always good.
I want to say I liked it.	They got this really big aquarium.
My name's Lucy.	I'll be your server.
It's in there.	Good luck, I guess.
Fring? Um, he knows.	I-- Welcome home.
Yeah, yeah, I want to.	Just-- just give me a couple minutes, huh? Hi.
Oh, daddy missed you so much.	Yes, he did.
What do you figure that was? I don't know.	Some kind of lab equipment? Maybe a camera? Come on.
You be nice.	Just be nice.
Let Wendell in there.	If Wendell doesn't eat, nobody eats.
Mike, wait a minute, all right? Let him talk.	"Let him talk.
" I am done listening to this asshole	Now get out of my way.
What is it with you guys? Honest to God.	May I? Look.
Whatever differences you and I have, they'll keep.	Right now we've got bigger fish to fry.
He kept it at the back of the restaurant.	It all fed straight to there.
What? Keys, scumbag.	It's the universal symbol for keys.
It's money out of your pocket.	It's money out of my pocket.
End of story.	APD, Northwest area command, on 2nd.
I am doing something.	He's good with this stuff.
Just give him a chance.	Now, you look.
Nursing home full of old folks just whet your appetite.	Now you want to kill a bunch of
I've never said anything about kill	I am, however, considering the possibility of a device.
Say this device gets filed into evidence.	Now, it is inside that room.
Yo, what about, like, a magnet? - An incendiary device.	One quick fire is all it would take.
My wife-- There's an IRS issue anyway.	I'd appreciate it if you could spot me my share.
Do you remember Sergeant Schultz? "I know nothing.	I see nothing.
And it's-- - Oh, Jesus.	What incident? An act of God.
There's no right.	There's no wrong.
I mean, it just-- that's the best phrase.	It fits, but we got a problem.
You high? Mix blood with chuntaros? - No way.	Well There's no need.
We got enough.	Hitters ain't the problem.
Oh, all right.	Well, I'll get out of your hair.
Or-- or we could order Chinese? - Sure.	There you go.
Sounds nice, being out in the woods all day.	Nah, it wasn't so great.
I got sunburned.	There were mosquitoes.
Been thinking about that job more and more lately.	Maybe I should've enjoyed it more.
Tagging trees is a lot better than chasing monsters.	I used to love to go camping.
Come see your brother.	There you go, sweetie.
Let's go see your brother.	Let's get him.
Come here, my baby girl.	You're gonna be a handful, aren't you? Yeah.
It's nice to see you smile again.	I mean, you seem good.
You know that.	It goes without saying, we love having them.
I gave up counting it.	I mean, I had to.
It was just so much, so fast.	I-- I tried weighing it.
Walt I want my kids back.	I want my life back.
Um, I-- I hope I'm not disturbing you or anything.	I tried calling, but, uh-- Yeah.
And you didn't answer your home line, so-- It's disconnected.	Oh, um, unplugged, I mean.
You, uh, didn't wind up moving, I see.	Didn't have to.
Saul told me what you did.	Anyways, uh, I'm not in jail.
You aren't either, so there you go.	There was no other option, Jesse.
It had to be done.	I'm not coming back.
I I saw a Bounder the other day.	Bounder? - Yeah.
Oh, you saw the same one as ours? Yeah.	Well, within a couple years, I guess.
A much nicer paint job.	No bullet holes in the
You know, like color - Yeah.	I don't know.
Did you have a coin collection? I had coins.	have the time to do hobbies.
Coins and baseball cards.	Those were the ones.
Stiff what? - Hey, hey.	I was interested to see you get into that.
Borage oil is supposed to be good.	It's like chemistry.
I like your style.	There is no Christmas.
I vote yes.	I second that.
Anybody, uh-- anybody want anything? Want anything? No, I'm good.	I'm good, thank you.
How's she doing? - She's good.	I used to have that halo.
Oh, my God, Skyler.	Okay, I'll take the pink one.
I hope it's not something you ate.	No, no, I just We have Pepto, Uncle Hank.
I have plenty of help.	And by that, she means me.
That is correct.	Holly can help.
Let's go say good-bye.	Let's go send them on their way.
Say, "Bye, Auntie.	" Bye, sweetie.
I can't believe it.	Were you there when she said that? - Yeah.
Oh, she was talking about it.	It sounds like it's-- We need to go to Europe.
It'd have to be, like, a business trip, you know.	It could, um-- We could go to Italy.
To, um, Lake Como.	It's "Como," right?  Hank.
Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Okay.	You okay? Just take a breath.
Oh, God, sweetheart.	It was an accident.
And do not tell Skyler.	What? Why? Just don't.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.	Hank? _ _ _  Hola, Mariano.
Here you go.	There's complimentary coffee inside.
I do love that location.	I'll think about it.
Welcome to A-1.	Just the regular, please.
Well, there's complimentary coffee inside while you're waiting.	Have an A-1 day.
A week at most.	Call it a tutorial.
Get the ship back on course.	We'll make it worth your while.
Listen, this is a complicated situation.	There are a lot of moving parts.
None of which are my concern.	You're putting me in a box here.
You know what could happen.	Again, none of my concern.
There's your change.	And if you'll hand this to your car wash professional.
And have an A-1 day.	Listen-- - It'll only be a few more minutes.
There's some complimentary coffee, if you like.	What's up? Just wondering who washes a rental car.
I got it.	Have a good day.
We could give you a hand sorting through them.	No, I got it.
I gotta write it down is all.	The Enterprise is five parsecs out of Rigel 12.
They're eating tulaberry pies-- - Tulaberry? Tulaberries.	From Gamma Quadrant, yo.
That's Voyager, dude.	Okay, blueberries then.
Okay, Spock always wins these things.	How is Spock gonna brat Kirk, yo? Spock's like a
Look at Kirk.	He's got room to spare.
Spock has total vulcan control over his digestion.	You wanna hear this or not? - Yeah, yeah, go.
Just fill this out.	Bring it back to me.
Jesse Pinkman's out here smoking pot.	Give me a break, man.
Pinkman, he'll see you now.	Woody Harrelson, live and in person.
Pull up a bong and take a seat.	Hey, I'm kidding about the bong.
Don't be doing that.	Uh, sorry to keep you on ice out there, kid.
If I'd known it was you, well Francesca.	I've warned her before.
One more time, and it's back to the DMV.	So, uh, are we on our own today?
Barn door open.	"Barn door"?  Oh.
It's 2 1/2 million each.	A total of five.
, uh, who? Drew Sharp's parents.	Drew Sharp-- that's the kid on TV.
I mean, kinda.	But this--  This is a bridge too far.
Enough bullshit, Saul.	Are you gonna do this or not? Yes, yes, absolutely.
You've looked better.	Just get it done.
You know who this is? Don't hang up on me.	Yeah, there's a problem.
I'll handle it.	D�j� vu, huh? Jesus.
It's It's blood money.	I s--  Jeez.
Nothing can change what we've done.	But now that's over.
Mike is perfectly capable of looking after his own granddaughter.	I don't think so.
I don't think he is capable.	I don't think he's coming back.
Listen to me.	I did not kill
It's not true.	It's just not.
Wherever he is.	We both know that he can take care of himself.
Are they bringing in someone new? I don't know.	Um, maybe she'll be back.
] Really? Really.	So you're spared a night out with the family.
You do not have to look so happy about it.	I'll be right back.
He hasn't been to work all week.	Well, good night.
Listen, tell everybody more work and less worry.	We better hit it.
How are you? Good to see you.	How you doing? Very good.
It's back to 100%.	We're going to District.
It's gonna be exciting.	When? This Saturday? This Saturday morning.
See you, Walt.	All right, Scott.
Which reminds me.	I better get back to it.
Ugh!  - Hank-- - It was you.	All along, it was you! You son of a bitch.
You kill ten witnesses to save your sorry	Listen to me-- - You bomb a nursing
I'm sorry you feel that way.	I wanna brat this
I don't know who you are.	I don't even know who I'm talking to.
All along it was you! Hank, my cancer is back.	In six months you won't have someone to prosecute.
Mariano, it's me.	I need you to get Skyler on the line.
Where is she? Where's Skyler? She just kinda left.	She didn't say where she was going.
Skyler, my-- my head is spinning.	And yours I-- I can't even imagine.
I just wished I'd seen it sooner.	He's a monster.
You're done being his victim.	Because here's what we're gonna do.
His cancer's back.	So he said.
What? No, no, no, no, you don't.	I-- I think maybe I do.
Skyler, understand, I am here to help you.	But to do that, I need your help.
But you don't know that.	Skyler, yes, I-- I do.
What are you doing? Huell.	Hey, quit screwing around.
Mm, mm, mm.	Ah, screw it.
Guy hit ten guys in jail within a two-minute window.	All's I'm saying.
This was the third message.	Where the hell is that kid? That's her.
Can't believe she went to him.	She just panicked.
She went right to him without even talking to me.	Without a moment's hesitation.
Nothing? Hank knows.	That's not nothing.
You know, where, uh, where Mike went to.	Off on a trip to, uh, Belize.
I'm just throwing thoughts out there.	This is a safe room, right? Jesus.
Send him to Belize.	I'll send you to Belize.
And we don't mind overtime.	Ain't no thing.
Pay Huell and Kuby and take your cut.	The rest is mine.
No, no, please-- please don't tell me he isn't there.	I know he's been avoiding my calls.
Let me in.	Let me talk to you.
Tell me he doesn't know what he's talking about.	You gotta give me something, Skyler.
Anything to help me understand.	It can't be true.
And your whole gambling story.	That was a lie.
I Did you know then? You had to.	Skyler did you know since before Hank was shit? Skyler?
What are you doing? She's coming with us.	No, she is not.
Come and help.	You are not leaving this house with my daughter.
Give her back to me.	I'm trying to protect her.
Listen, I will call the police.	You call them.
Give me my baby.	Marie, put her down.
Give me my baby.	Skyler, we are not leaving without her.
Give me my baby right now! Marie! Do it now.	Give her back.
Okay, mama has you now.	Mama has you now.
How are you feeling? It's true.	The cancer's back.
I know you talked with Hank.	I know you made a deal.
Skyler, I'll make this easy.	I'll give myself up.
If you promise me one thing.	You keep the money.
Never speak of it.	Never give it up.
You pass it on to our children.	Give them everything.
It was me.	I screwed up.
The way Hank talks he's got his suspicions.	Not much else.
You can't give yourself up without giving up the money.	It's the way this works, Walt.
So maybe our best move here is to stay quiet.	Okay, you can take it off now.
Yeah, well, the product we're making, it's selling just fine.	Heisenberg's standards don't matter anymore.
You can do better, do better.	Yeah, I don't know what to tell you.
Look, I tried Heisenberg's way.	It didn't work out.
We have a problem.	You stay here.
Are you kidding me with this? Uncle Jack.	Fire in the hole.
Let's take it all.	Let's get everything.
Put the whole DEA on it.	That's how this is supposed to work, right? No.
When I go in there I'm bringing proof, not suspicions.	I can be the man who caught him.
I had to see it with my own eyes.	How you doing? Good.
I didn't know you had balls.	All right, don't make me sorry I stopped by here.
Pinkman? I'll give you this.	Jesse, you're never boring.
Not boring at all.	So come on, buddy.
Won it in a card game.	Lucky night at the casino.
That is not going to happen.	I don't even know who I'm talking to.
And finally Mr.	White tells me to cut it.
Like, total stuntman stuff.	It's like Hooper.
But he jumped out of a helicopter, not a train.	Well, whatever, man.
That's a tight operation.	It was-- it was perfect.
I'm ready for the check.	You feeling good about cooking? Yeah.
Let's make some money, then.	I gotta hit the head.
I wanna talk to you about your partner, Heisenberg.	See, I know he's my brother-in-law, Walt.
Lucky for you, I'm more interested in him.	So I got an offer.
I know you want that.	I think you wanna talk.
Keep your left up.	Detectives, I'm inviting you to leave.
I imagine Schrader shared with you his recent discovery.	Okay, well, then you get my complete lack of chill.
Just-- just make it happen.	Work your magic.
See you later.	Wait, uh Son? Junior? Hang on a second.
Yeah? Oh, good.	Come on back inside.
What happened? Oh, this? Nothing.	No, I'm fine.
Very-- very briefly.	And I did this.
But I-- I was pushing myself too hard.	I know it.
I just don't want you to worry.	I learned my lesson.
There's no reason to think I won't again.	And my doctor says I'm doing great.
No, it's past time.	Way past time.
We talked about this.	You've got to tell them now.
I live at Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.	This is my confession.
Skyler and I-- Welcome to Garduno's! My name's Trent.	I'll be taking care of you today.
So you here to confess? There's nothing to confess.	We're here to talk about Walter, Jr.
Flynn and Holly should be living with us.	End of story.
They need to understand.	It's in the past.
That affair of yours? Did that even happen? Please.	Look, Junior just found out that my cancer is back.
That is not a solution.	No, it's not a solution.
That is not what we're saying-- Enough with the bullshit.	You're not gonna negotiate your way out of this thing.
My name is Walter Hartwell White.	I live at Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.
It's what he will do if I don't back off.	I think you should show this to Ramey.
Just get ahead of it.	That video is a bunch of lies, Hank.
What was gambling money? Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie.	Oh, God, no.
Oh, Christ, Marie.	You kill me
I mean, it's the-- that's the last nail.	That's the last nail in the coffin.
I wouldn't have driven it here if it wasn't.	Um, get one of these, by the way.
Maybe it's time for a change.	What kinda change? I don't know.
Just get out of town.	Don't look back.
Saul knows a man.	He specializes in giving people new identities.
Sounds a little extreme.	But maybe it's exactly what you need.
Something you like.	Meet a girl.
Start a family, even.	Hell, you're still so damn young.
And what's here for you now anyway? I tell ya.	If I could, I'd trade places.
Just say so.	Just ask me for a favor.
I put them on it.	You wanna explain that to me? Yeah.
You gotta tell me what's going on.	Pinkman is APD's problem, not ours.
Take them off.	I said take them off.
This is it.	Once I make the call, there's no take-backs.
Uh, not hot hot, just a little hot.	Currently out on bail.
Some people are immune to good advice.	I'm gonna get a bag for this cash.
Don't even think about lighting up again.	Francesca, we got any bags? For money.
Corner of Juan Tabo and Osuna.	You, you're gonna sit and wait.
This guy's punctual with a capital P.	Okay? So don't move.
Don't get up and get an ice cream.	Just stay put like a good boy.
He'll pick you up.	You'll pay him.
He'll take your ID.	He'll give you a new one.
Back off! You, stay where you are.	What? I don't know what happened here.
18, 19, and 20.	Actually, you gave me a five, not a one.
Oh, I-- I did.	I'm-- I'm so sorry.
Um, here you go.	Thank you for your honesty.
Yeah? Nothing? - No.	Things are fine.
I like that.	Thank you very much.
Just find him.	Please leave your message.
No, same key, same locks.	The old keys have to work here, okay? - Okay.
Oh, no, no.	Um, hey, guys, guys, guys.
Well, we've made three passes already.	Like I say, gasoline's tricky.
No, no, no, no.	No, no, no, no, no.
Understand? I-- I know.	This is short notice, and I really appreciate it.
This is as good as it gets.	So, um, pump malfunction? Yeah.
The-- the metal thing.	The thing you squeeze, right? I hear a chunk.
You know, for tires.	Anyway, so that was my day.
No, the-- no.	It was the pump.
Hey, what about a hotel? A hotel.	That could be sweet.
A-- a good one.	I like the way you're thinking.
It's not my finest hour.	I'll go pack a bag.
Uh, AA meeting off the 40.	His buddies, Beaver and what's-his-name? Uh, Badger and Skinny Pete.
Yeah, no, he's not with them.	They could be covering for him.
I posed as a meter reader.	I put a bug in the tall kid's mom's place.
I'm wondering what you wanna do when he does.	Jesse is upset about the boy.
But here we are.	Checked in on Junior.
Pay-per-view and room service.	He's in heaven.
Hey, I thought you were gonna take a bath.	How's Saul doing? Saul? Goodman? I have no idea.
Were you spying on me? Yes.	And I feel just awful about it too.
I did do it.	But I did it for very good reasons.
Make him see reason.	"Talk to him.
What? Wh-what does that mean? My God.	I knew this was going to happen.
Jesse didn't go there to hurt anyone.	He poured gasoline all over our house, Walt.
He tried to set our house on fire.	He changed his mind.
He poisoned a little kid.	An eight-year-old boy.
And you don't wanna be	So put it out.
It's It's gonna go great for me.	So you're angry.
I can't sleep.	I'm not eating.
Not like this.	Not like him.
It'd be bad for Hank.	Our friend made that clear in his little movie.
Nothing suspicious about that at all.	Tell me about this movie.
I wouldn't hurt anybody.	I just It just feels good to think about it.
What happened? Are you in danger? No.	No, no, no, not at all.
He was a little keyed-up.	Gave him a couple sleeping pills.
Everything okay? - Oh, yeah.	Just business stuff.
Should've brought our suits, huh? It's okay.	It's all right.
Would you like some coffee? Morning.	You want some coffee? Uh, no.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	I'll run some errands.
We're gonna catch him.	We gotta do this first, okay? Come on.
Anything and everything.	Just tell us your story, okay? Start from the beginning.
When did you first meet Walter White? Right.	Okay, uh I first met Mr.
White-- Walter White-- in junior year chemistry.	He was my teacher.
You believe him? Yeah.	I do, unfortunately.
Yeah, well, no weapon, no bodies, no working	Just the word of one nut-job meth-head against Mr.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.	Go and talk to that asshole? You-- you can't be
Go and listen.	He wants to explain himself.
Except when it comes to you.	He cares about you.
White's gay for me.	Everyone knows that.
No, I mean it.	Based on everything you told us.
Uh, made you a 50-50 partner.	He didn't need to do that.
Look-- look, you two guys are just guys, okay? Mr.	White-- he's the devil.
This is what's happening.	I gotta piss.
Can I piss? Yeah.	Down to the left.
Don't cross your arms, if you can help it.	Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.	You getting that? Loud and clear, idiota.
How's it looking, Gomie? No change.	He's just sitting there.
He's taking off.	I think he's running.
You got him? He's at the pay phone.	Who the hell is he calling? Oh, no.
No, no, no.	Come on, kid.
No! Come on! Hello? Nice try,	Jesse, where are you? I just wanna talk to you.
Next time, I'm gonna get you where you really live.	Jesse, listen to me.
What? To get him.	There's another way.
Put out the lighter.	He can't keep getting away with it! He won't.
If I go to this plaza, I'm a dead man.	Next time I'm gonna get you where you really live.
Uncle Jack, that mask I think you should Mr.	White says the fumes aren't good to breathe.
Let me worry about what I breathe, kid.	Just hurry this up so I can grab a smoke.
Nice going, nephew.	Thanks, Uncle Jack.
Yes, percentage-wise, it's marginally improved.	And congratulations, Todd.
To my eye, it's kind of blue.	Yeah, a little.
Hell, we'll put food coloring in it.	Make it any damn shade you want.
Let's make some money.	Here you go, Ms.
You burned it, like a	Yeah, sort of, I guess.
I believe in you.	Please do make the cook better.
It's very important to me.	I've got a flight to catch.
White? - Just one target.	Not currently in jail.
Had a lot of questions.	No calls, though, right? You got his phone? Yeah.
He's on ice? The safe house off Rio Bravo.	I got Van Oster babysitting him.
He won't lawyer up.	What the hell, man? Ugh.
Nice poker face.	Look, uh, relax.
Let's cut to the chase.	We have a wire on Walt's phone.
We got the recording.	I can-- I can let you hear it.
I don't know where his money is.	That ain't what we heard.
You know, plastic, black, I got 'em at Home Depot.	Filled up every last damn one of 'em too.
And, uh, where did you rent the van? Lariat.	The one on Candelaria and Monroe.
That's all I know.	All right, uh, Mr.
So don't put that back in.	Agent Van Oster will stay here with you.
You're in good hands.	He's our best man with a
So just one guy this time.	Not even in lockup.
"Rat patrol"? No.	No, he's not a rat.
He's just angry.	He's not a rat.
bullet to the back of the	Something he doesn't see coming.
I respect that.	There's too many savages out there.
Let's just talk about the money.	No, we don't want your money.
We want you to cook for us.	You know I'm out of the business.
One cook after the job is done.	Time is of the essence.
Do you understand? We'll do him tonight if you want.	Just tell me where he is.
I don't know if you remember me.	I'm Walter White, Jesse's friend.
You met Brock before, right? Yes.	Yes, I have.
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.	I have his card somewhere.
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.	Your friend Walter just dropped by.
Thank you, Andrea.	I appreciate that.
I'll call you back, okay? And thank you.	See ya, Brock.
We on? Yes.	It should be any time now.
And take him away from here.	I don't want the mother or the boy to know.
You got it.	Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.
Here's your change.	Oh, um, count it out, please.
That is 20.	Give this to your car wash professional.
Have an A-1 day.	Oh, you too.
Excuse me, son.	That'll be 14.
How you doin'? Y-you're on our billboard.	You're-- - you're the lawyer guy.
So, three makes 15, and 20, 25, 30, Thank you.	I like your commercial.
Don't drink and drive.	But if you do, call me.
Have an A-1 day.	Mom, you, um-- you forgot to say it.
Nobody's seen him.	He's not answering his phone.
So what about Jesse? He hasn't shown up yet.	He will, Saul.
Next thing I know, radio silence.	You're the math whiz.
Add up two and two.	Jesse is not on some kill
It's me he wants.	It's just me.
Next-- inventory lists.	uh, ten pine-scented air fresheners.
You get the picture? I get it.	I get it.
There goes ten G's.	Aw, nice orange flames.
You're not hurting anyone but my family.	Okay? Look, I-- I can't spend this money.
It's not for me.	I won't be around long enough to use it.
It belongs to my children.	Oh, you're gonna talk about kids.
You're seriously gonna go there? I am sorry about Brock.	No, you're not.
Where are you? Son of a bitch.	Son of a bitch.
No, no, no.	Come on, come on.
I'm guessing he's got backup.	How many guys? - I don-- I-- I don't know.
Where are you? - Tohajiilee.	Indian reservation, west of town.
"34, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.	" Those are coordinates.
It looks like there could be three men total.	Wait a minute.
What? What is it? Stay in the car.	Oh, my God.
Lace your fingers behind your head.	Walk backwards to me.
Yo, I remember this place.	The very first place we cooked, like, ever.
I got him.	Dead to rights.
You got Walt? Yeah.	I got him in handcuffs as we speak.
I gotta go.	It may be awhile before I get home.
I love you.	I love you too.
Where are you? - Get a pen.	Jack, don't come.
I've got him.	Dead to rights.
No, no, no.	Not in here.
Yeah, yeah, sure.	I can-- I can pick up a pizza.
Hopefully Bogdan won't keep me too late.	He better not.
Just feels right, you know? It's my new favorite.	Well, it's a front-runner, for sure.
Oh, my God.	We haven't been there in forever.
Get back here.	The hell not? He's DEA.
No, he's-- he's family.	Say again? He's my family.
Well, it seems to me we did you a solid.	You weren't supposed to be here.
It doesn't concern you.	We just wasted his partner here, and he's wearing a
So, yeah, I'd say it does concern me.	This is between him and me.
No cavalry comin'? No.	You bet your ass the cavalry's comin'.
You can go anywhere.	You can do anything.
Think about it.	You can have any future that you want.
And you can go fuck	Hank listen to me.
Do what you're gonna do.	Pretty specific directions.
Hell yeah! Oh, Jesus.	Would you look at that?  Hell yeah!
Let me get on this side.	Out of there, man.
I'm leaving you a barrel.	Boys are gonna load it for you.
Good to go? Hey, Uncle Jack.	Well, he was out here with those feds.
Works for me.	Work for you? - Let's go.
I watched Jane die.	I was there.
And I watched her die.	I watched her overdose and choke to death.
I could have saved her.	But I didn't.
That truck belong to you? It does.	I'd like to buy it.
It's not for sale.	Hey, Walt, it's me.
What have you been up to? Oh, you know.	This and that.
This isn't the best time.	Well, Flynn looks like he can hold down the fort.
Well, I do.	So you can just sit there and listen.
I got a call from Hank.	He arrested Walt three hours ago.
And I, for one, could not be happier.	I almost didn't come here.
And you have got to prepare yourself.	Hank will help you as much as he can.
I know he will.	And I will support you through this.
You understand me? Answer me.	Do you understand me? Yes.
He deserves to know the truth from his family.	Not a bunch of uniformed strangers.
No. No. No, he cannot-- No.	You tell him. Or I will.
There's no way around this.	He needs to know, and he needs to know now.
Just-- just go there.	Just go to his house and get it.
We're on it.	Get it! No one else knows about it.
No one else knows! I swear!  Let's cook.	You're completely out of your mind.
It's the truth.	It is, Flynn.
Then both of you are out of your minds.	You're full of shit, is what you are.
This is bullshit.	I wanna talk to dad.
Whose truck is that? [Walter, Jr.	] Dad? Listen.
Just talk to me please.	Our priority right now is to pack.
This is our priority.	Hank had you in custody.
We can have a fresh start.	Whole new lives.
All we have to do is go.	We have to go right now.
No!  I tried to save him.	Uncle Hank is dead? I-- Mom, it can't be true.
Just stop, please.	It just can't be true.
Everything-- everything is gonna be okay.	Everything's gonna be fine.
I promise you.	But we need to leave right now.
Dad, what's going on? Talk to me.	Just stop for one second.
Look, I told you to get your things.	Stop walking away.
We're going right now.	You have to tell me.
Aah!  [Walter, Jr.	] Stop it.
Get away from us! [Walter, Jr.	] Just stop! Stop! Just stop it! Mom, stop it.
My dad, he pulled a knife on my mom.	He attacked her.
Yeah, he's-- he's still in the house.	We're at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.
Where's your belly button? Where's your belly button? There.	Now don't you feel better? You're all nice and dry.
Gold, wire-framed glasses.	Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please, leave a message.	Skyler, it's me.
I need you to pick up the phone.	Start tracing the landline.
Skyler - The number's 505-177-8987.	I know you're there, so pick it up.
Skyler? - Need the location of an incoming caller.	You hear me? Answer the pho-- Walt.
I told you, Skyler.	I warned you for a solid year.
'Cause you need to learn.	You bring her back.
Maybe now you'll listen.	Maybe now you'll use your damn head.
Walt, you have to stop.	You have to stop this.
You stupid bitch.	How dare you? I'm sorry.
Tell me what happened.	Where is Hank? Please.
We need to know.	You're never gonna see Hank again.
He crossed me.	You think about that.
Family or no.	You let that sink in.
I've still got things left to do.	_  Hey.
Put the knife down, please.	Get out! - Ah! Ahh! I need the police.
Leave your luggage where it is for the moment.	That good? Sure.
What's in Nebraska? You.	From now on.
I got a place downstairs, out of sight.	It's not the Ritz-Carlton, but it's comfortable enough for short-term.
He's a special case.	Gonna take some doing.
How's he holding up? You be the judge.	We will find Hank.
When he saw the gun, he thought-- Hey,	Does this pussy cry through the entire thing? Just
Such a bitch.	He won't quit.
Like it was nothing.	Hey, Uncle Jack.
Give me a list of hitters, mercenaries.	Yes, yes, I remember.
We'll take the time to vet them.	Make sure there are no undercover cops on the team.
Five should do it.	Providing they're the right men for the job.
I don't know any hit men.	You know a guy who knows a guy.
Just get me the contacts.	Anybody in that world.
I'm paying top dollar.	We'll find them.
The phone call was a smart move.	Kudos to you.
Odds are it was recorded.	It's gonna play great for a jury.
It might even buy her a mistrial.	In a year and a half.
She knows nothing.	Well, too bad for her, then.
That condo is gone.	Your bank accounts, they're frozen.
Her picture's probably on TV right now, next to yours.	Who's gonna hire her? Money's no problem.
Internet, the phone-- it's all tapped.	Hey, Mike was no dummy.
Maybe they let your family stay in the house.	After all, the house predates the criminal enterprise.
What I do, I do for my family.	My money goes to my children.
And then, and only then Am I through.	Do you understand? Everything good? Define "good.
" You're set.	Time to go.
You'll be a little longer.	I'm still working on transportation.
Change of plans.	He's coming with me.
I can use him.	I'll give you two a minute.
Hey, I'm a civilian.	I'm not your lawyer anymore.
I'm nobody's lawyer.	The fun's over.
You're still part of this.	Whether you like it or not.
You remember what I told you? It's not over.	Unti It's over.
I don't know where he is.	All right, go and discuss this with your lawyer here.
You gotta do that.	But you've seen some people.
Like that lady who came into the car wash.	The one with the black hair.
Okay, ma'am, I'm gonna need you to say it.	I will not say anything about her.
Stay where you are.	We'll talk like this.
I mean, the message was received loud and clear.	The message? Yeah.
Look, I know you did your best.	I just think-- Hi.
You're not Western Union, Todd.	We can't just settle for you sending messages.
I'm just-- I'm not used to this kind of risk.	We're gonna have to take a break.
And it's blue.	Just like before.
That's Heisenberg level.	He's not with you? Well, next best thing.
Well, they're not going to find him.	He's with us, and he's not going anywhere.
We make a good team.	I think it's kind of mutually good.
Ought to warm the place up pretty good.	Plus you can cook on it.
On the TV front, the reception's pretty much nil.	You got some mountains in the way.
Internet? Same deal.	Also satellite, cable TV, drop phone, car.
You want news, I'll bring the Albuquerque papers.	Whatever you need, just - put it on the list.
Look, I have business to conduct.	Your business is your business.
My business is keeping you out of custody.	You are the target of a nation-wide manhunt.
Your face is all over TV.	You are the hottest client I have ever had.
And what's keeping me from walking out that gate? Nothing.	There's a little one-horse town eight miles down the hill.
Hey, you awake? Huh? Yeah.	We had some Ben and Jerry's.
There you go.	So that batch that you just cooked was 96%.
Well, better get some sleep.	Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.
Got a whole new batch.	Hey, um, Todd.
Actually, I brought him with me.	Jesse's here? Yeah, he's right over there.
In that truck.	Where? No! Just so you know, this isn't personal.
I brought you a couple of cases of ensure.	Maybe put a little weight on you.
Kids are both still with her for the moment.	Uh, there's no court date yet.
Looks like a deer in the headlights.	Think I got socks older than him.
I saw her shopping one time.	She looks pretty good.
And she's using her maiden name.	I wouldn't take that personally under the circumstances.
Those working for you? Oh, yeah.	I took a run by your old house.
Uh, the auction's still pending.	They put a fence up around it.
The neighbors complained, so the bank put up a fence.	You ready? Hmm? Yeah.
Sorry about last time.	It should go better now.
I watched a couple of YouTube videos.	It's all about finding the vein.
Give it to me.	I'll do it.
Think I had worse my last physical.	I will see you on Let's see.
Cards? All right, well The game will be Seven Card.	I'll deal, since you are encumbered.
I'm sorry to pull you out of class.	It's your Aunt Marie.
It sounds very important.	You can take it in here, okay? Okay.
Hey, Aunt Marie.	Um, what's-- what's going on? Hold on a sec, honey.
Son, it's me.	Please don't let on.
Carmen's nearby, right? She cannot know.	Son, are you there? Ye-- yes.
I'm sending Louis a package.	Now, it's addressed to Louis, but it's for you.
Your mother and your sister.	There's-- there's money inside.
It was all that I could fit into the box.	It has to be a secret.
So you'll-- you'll talk to Louis, right? You kill Uncle	You kill him!
What you did to mom-- you	You kill Uncle
Listen to me.	You've got to listen to me.
Just shut up.	Just stop it.
Sto-- stop it.	I don't want anything from you.
I don't give a shit.	You need this money.
Your mother-- You kill Uncle	You kill him! Your mother needs this
It can't all be for nothing.	What you did-- Just shut up.
The company name.	We came up with it by combining our names.
Uh, "Schwartz" means black, black plus White makes gray.	It's Gray Matter Technologies.
Show me your hands.	Just get me home.
Just get me home.	I'll do the rest.
Let me get a pen.	Where do they Tesuque, I see.
No, no, it's-- it's their call.	I know how busy Mr.
All right, wait.	The answer is  - No.
The sweet smell of success.	And per se has Thomas Keller.
Game, set, and match.	The whole vibe is so Yountville.
What, Islamabad? - No, Napa.	We have to go to Napa.
Unless you told her otherwise.	No, I haven't talked to her.
Oh, look, here.	Just a pear, that'll be perfect.
You looked great.	You both did.
It'll all fit.	That's all right.
They won't take my money.	Even if they did, the federal government wouldn't let them.
It certainly would.	My children are blameless victims of their monstrous father.
They use my money, never yours.	Okay, Walt, sure.
Absolutely you can.	Oh! Don't move.
Cheer up, beautiful people.	This is where you get to make it right.
For real, yo.	Whole thing felt kinda shady, you know, like, morality-wise? Totally.
How do you feel now? Better.	Yeah, definitely improving.
Seriously? You said he moved to Alaska.	That's what I heard.
Right on, Jesse.	Passing the torch.
It's easy money.	Until we catch you.
Would you like to see a menu? No, thank you.	Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.
All right, you got it.	Hey, how you doing? Good.
How's things? Hey, I like your shirt.	My blouse? Nice, yeah, the color.
It's kind of a cornflower.	Before you say or do anything, just hear me out.
Todd-- Nobody knows that I'm here.	Just listen for two minutes and then I'll leave.
Just two minutes of your time.	That's all I ask.
You've been at it long enough.	You must be running low.
I have a new method that requires no methylamine.	And it's easy, and it will keep you in business.
I need the money.	I've spent almost all of mine.
He'd get it.	This is a win-win situation.
Skyler--  Hey.	What's up? Walt's in town.
Carol's on the right.	Becky, Carol, whatever.
She saw him at your old house.	Just this morning, plain as day.
They're probably watching your place, too.	I mean, I know that's what Hank would do.
There's no way Walt's getting to you.	They are absolutely going to catch him.
No doubt about it.	That arrogant asshole thinks he's some criminal mastermind, but he's
Didn't have to.	You look terrible.
And I needed a proper goodbye.	Not our last phone call.
What's tonight? We don't want your money, Walt.	I thought Flynn made that clear.
I spent the last of it getting here.	All I have to give you is this.
Call the DEA once I leave.	Tell them I was here.
Those numbers are GPS coordinates.	For what? A burial site.
That's where they'll find Hank and Steve Gomez.	That's where I buried our money.
I liked it.	I was good at it.
And I was really I was alive.	Flynn will be home soon.
Before I go may I see her? Whoo.	Damn man, this thing's a classic.
What block you got in it? Couldn't tell you.	That's the one you want.
No replacement for displacement.	Where to? To the clubhouse.
Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.	Okay? My wallet and keys? Yeah, you'll get them back.
Keep your eyes open.	Jesus, look at you with that head of hair.
Is that real? Yes.	That's not a wig? Seriously? No.
What were you doing before, shaving it? Yes.	Christ, that is one fine head of hair.
The heat's off her.	She can break loose a barrel every now and again.
Hey, come on.	You owe me.
Instead, you partnered with him.	You're his partner now-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.
Well, go get him.	Bring him here.
Uncle Jack-- - No.	No, no, no.
Now, this look like a partner to you? Come here.	Take a look.
Come here! Take a look at him.	Have a gander.
This is my partner.	Right, partner? Right, buddy? Hardworking, good partner.
You want this.	Say the words.
Then do it yourself.	Pick up the phone.
They're all gone.	Todd? Who is this? It's Walt.
Oh, my God.	Well goodbye, Lydia.
