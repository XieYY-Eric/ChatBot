Well, thank you.	You're late again.
Yeah. I think it's getting better.	What the hell is this?
It's veggie bacon. We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.	Not me. I want real bacon. Not this fake crap.
Too bad. Eat it.	This smells like Band-aids.
Eat your veggie bacon.	You all set?
Yeah, I'm fine.	All right, see you at home.
Okay, see you.	Chemistry. It is the study of what? Anyone? Ben.
She's showing a little.	Carmen, this is my sister Marie.
Nice, isn't it?	Dad, come check this out.
Yeah, I see it.	Come on, take it.
Check it out, Walt.	No, no, it's just heavy.
Were any shots fired?	No, ma'am. Our agents took the suspects by surprise.
That faux-Lalique vase I picked up at the Super-Swap.	How's it doing?
Until what time? Noon? 1-ish?	Probably 2, more like it.
What is going on down there?	No, it's just...
You understood what I've just said to you?	Yes. Lung cancer. Inoperable.
Phosphine gas. I think.	Yeah, exactly. One whiff will kill you. That's why the
Driver's license says Emilio Koyama.	Asian! Pay up, sucker.
Oh, my God. Pinkman?	It's me. I'm alone.
I own it.	No one's looking for you.
Somebody bought it?	Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis. 14 dollars plus shipping.
Open offer. So what's up with Walt lately?	What do you mean? He's fine.
So it's a mid-life crisis.	No, he's just quiet.
Guess that answers that.	a round bottom boiling flask.
Buy the RV. We start tomorrow.	How's it coming in there?
Cow house. God help me.	What are you doing?
Would you shut up and help me?	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, work it. Baby, work it.
It's all right? It's all right?	Yeah, it's all right. So, what? You back in business?
I say we cap 'em both.	Hey, you really cook up that batch?
Twelve Hours Earlier	You are a lifesaver.
Dude, you so need GPS. I mean, for real.	Like I said, we couldn't be more grateful.
You have a good day, sweetie.	Okay, Mom. You too.
Oh, no, no not good. Not good.	What the...hey, you. Listen No, no, no, no! Oh, God!
No, not him so much. His cousin, mainly.	Who's his cousin?
The guy out in the RV!	All right, all right.
Krazy-8's one level higher.	One level higher?
I'll do the body in the acid, okay?	Heads or tails?
Not yet. God. I gotta go.	What? No, come back here!
Just a minute. I wanna talk to you.	No, I'm not interested.
Iron. Wow, okay. .00004%.	What? You can't have hemoglobin without iron.
Apparently, it don't take much.	No, it don't. Go figure. Sodium.
What? No! No. What would make you evenï¿½	Where's he getting it from?
How do you know my name?	Jesse. He told Emilio and me.
No! No way!	Where the hell do you think you're going?
Back off, man! Jesus!	We've got work to do!
Excuse me. His own mother seems to think so.	Skyler told you that?
She inferred it.	She inferred it, huh?
Good. Scare him straight.	Where's my sugar?
No, not really.	Think you'd like to live here?
A cop and some football player messing with me.	They ask about me? Huh?
What does your dad do?	He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.
Yeah. You do.	I'll get the key.
That's very understanding.	Whatever, man. I just want to go home.
You got something?	I don't know. Just doesn't it seem like something's missing?
What about the soul?	The soul. There's nothing but chemistry here.
I don't know. It's store-bought.	Hank, you need another beer?
Marie, some more wine, maybe?	I'm all right, thanks.
Honey, do you need anything?	No, Walt. Thank you.
What's she talking about? Walt.	I have cancer. Lung cancer. It's bad.
Ask him how long he's known.	I guess a month, maybe, or...
No, thanks, man. Pass.	Your loss. These are from Canada or something. Imported.
Say, Jesse. You still cook a little crystal?	Could be, yeah. You know, from time to time.
Do you need some help?	No, I'm fine, honey. I'm fine. Just Privacy. Thanks.
What's that we're putting on a credit card?	It's just a deposit kind of thing.
What can I do for you?	Which dude? The dude that looked like a lizard?
Dude, play some, play some Jethro Tull.	Hey, guys. How are we doing in here?
Nobody. What are you, nuts?	Then why are you here?
What? I'm just saying.	Go and don't come back. Now!
It was pretty awesome.	Retirement? I can't be hearing this!
It's a stupid gift.	No, it isn't. He'll love it.
Oh, come on.	Sir, I'll take that for you.
Walt! You made it.	Happy birthday. Wouldn't miss it for the world.
Thank you. It's really nice to be here.	When are you due?
Walt? I thought that was you.	Farley! Long time no see.
Well, no. No, that's Gretchen and Elliott.	I gravitated toward education.
Oh God, I miss this, Walt.	Yeah. Me, too.
Look, there's nothing we can't work out.	Well, yeah, but it's complicated.
You ready to go?	I'm taking the bus.
Okay bye, honey.	Hey, dude, are these bullet
No, man. Those are for, like, you know, ventilation.	Cool. Nice set-up, huh?
Okay. We're in business. Right on, Badger.	Dude, check this out.
Jesus, what the hell are you bringing that for?	Hunting. We might see javelinas.
What about him?	Are you kidding? He looks younger than us.
Why do I have to do it?	Give me the crutches and I'll go do it.
No, it's not?	Yeah, it is.
He admitted it. He said he liked it.	Walt? I didn't think he had it in him.
It's not right.	What do you mean it's not right?
We'll just do it again until we get it right.	Walt, please have a seat and join us.
This is bullshit.	Hey, come on.
It's all right. Talk. Tell your dad how you feel.	I'm pissed off.
My husband's life we're talking about!	Ladies. Come on.
How dare you?	This is so stupid.
All right what?	I'll do the treatment. It's gonna be okay.
And then Elliott will send a check.	I will take care of it.
Elliott told me about the cancer. I'm so sorry.	Well, you know, it is what it is, I guess.
Good, that's good news.	You know, that really was a great party.
Keep in touch, okay?	Sure. Sure. Thank you for calling.
No matter what happens, no more bloodshed. No violence.	Walt? You all right?
So we're good. We're good.	Could you not deposit this until Monday? Thank you.
No. I'm just dizzy.	Come here. Sit down, sit down.
I'm burning up.	Take this off. Sit down. Get some air.
Oh, God. Yeah, that's better.	When were you going to tell me?
Tell you what?	Cancer. You got it, right?
Your aunt. How bad was she when they caught it?	Bad enough. She didn't last long.
"Property of J. P. Wynne Chemistry Lab." That's Walt's school.	We were supposed to start at 3.
26 big ones.	Is that all? $26,000?
Yeah, I mean I used to until you kill	So who took Krazy-8's place?
You just don't get it, man. This guy's O.G.	What does that mean?
Wait till Monday again?	Yes, please. Thank you.
I'll need to take a look at that inventory.	Sure. I got a list hanging on the wall.
You mind if I take a look at your storeroom?	Not at all, no. Be my guest.
How about students?	No, no. No students have keys.
We don't want people to start wondering about you, right?	Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.
Hey, man. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.	Break out the ice. Take a bump.
No worries, man. I'm no cop.	I said hit it.
I cooked it.	Bullshit! Who you working for?
See? I told you Tuco would hook you up.	Cool. I haven't said how much.
All right. How much?	35 large for the pound.
You'll get it. This is a consignment operation.	You want me to float 35 G's?
Don't front, dude. Tuco's good for it.	I don't need your punk ass to vouch for me!
Hank's about to deal.	Okay. I'll be right there.
All right. Let's see what the turn brings us.	You're looking good, Walt. Your color's better.
Check's in the mail. 10 million.	Red's 25 million. Blue's 10.
You the guy?	Yeah, I'm the guy. How is he?
Good morning. Would you pass the butter, please?	Bad ass, Dad.
No. Please. No one said anything about LSD.	What about the equipment that was stolen?
I'm here to see the owner.	He's in the recreational vehicle.
Yo, it's appointment only!	How you feeling?
So Tuco gave you this is what you're saying.	We made a deal.
Here we are.	Skyler, you look great.
How do you feel?	Oh, okay. You know, pretty decent actually.
I want all of it. 70 grand.	What did you say?
Okay. That's $65,625 with interest. 1.875 pounds.	No. 2 pounds. Next Friday. And no production problems.
Thank you. Look at the little feet.	From me. And Hank.
You think it's a good idea?	Hank, I've already got lung cancer.
Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?	It's funny, isn't it? How we draw that line.
You mean like pot?	Yeah. Like pot. Or whatever.
Methylamine. Where's the methylamine? I don't see the methylamine.	Yeah, well, that's where I ran into some trouble.
So why don't we just steal it ourselves?	Yeah? How are we going to do that?
So who gave it to you, then?	I don't think I have to tell you that.
I don't know. There he is.	Yeah, I see him.
Wait till he passes.	Okay, it's clear. What the hell is this?
Oh, God. Carry your bag.	What? What are you doing?
Okay, there is it.	Is this going to be loud?
Where are the gallon jugs?	I don't know.
How is it going to be any different?	Can I just try it?
What part of slow it down did you not understand?	You talk too much. It's heavy, man.
What were you doing at Zachary's?	I was returning it.
Excuse me. I'd just like to see the basement.	Yeah, well, it's occupied.
So how was it? Was it an experience?	Yeah. It was definitely an experience.
What's that smell?	Yeah. It's sacred Navajo herbs and, hey, is everything okay?
Just remember who you're working for.	What did you say?
Just remember who you're working for.	What did you say?
Do something? He needs an ambulance. He needs a hospital.	Do something! You're smart, right? Do that thing!
No, there's nothing.	Breathe into his mouth.
This is conjecture?	Yes. And conjecture isn't helping.
What do you mean how would I do it?	Specifically, how would you do it? Step by step.
Three shots, or, I don't know, two.	But is it two, or is it three?
Obviously she's not home.	What was that about Chinese?
Dinner tonight. That new place.	How late they serve?
I don't know.	You got Dave at 8.
This is them. Check this out.	Holy shit. What was that?
How would he know where I live?	You're sure it was Tuco?
We are going to process them into ricin.	Rice and beans?
No, come on in.	I should've called first. I'm sorry.
What can I do for you?	Maybe we ought to sit down first?
That's all it takes?	That's all it takes.
Not if Tuco kill us	Just keep it down. Hey, Hank. What's up?
Me and my big mouth, I guess.	Well, that happens. It's no problem. No worries.
Well, thanks, man. I appreciate that. Jesus, the wives, huh?	Hank, unfortunately, I really...
Do you mind if I get in there?	No, go ahead.
I don't know where to begin.	What the hell are you doing here?
Damn. You don't think he...Holler if you need me.	Thanks a lot, man. Appreciate that.
I'm looking into it.	What phone call?
Second cell phone.	Yeah. I'm thinkin' that.
Get away from me!	Settle down, bitch!
Don't do this, Tuco.	No more posters?
Yeah, man. I mean, me, neither.	Who's talking to you?
We can't just ignore a potential clue, Hank.	Okay. What are you talking about?
Walt? Please. What about the marijuana?	He's not on pot anymore.
Oh, my God. Is my son in trouble?	I have absolutely no reason to think that, no.
Jesus! I don't want to die!	Tell me what you did!
Let him bleed. The keys! Oh, my God. The cousins?	What the hell's going on?
My God. I'm so sorry. Come here.	You know who I am, right?
What a day this has been?	So, Uncle Hank. He was in a
But where did this happen? How could he be...	Walt, everything's okay. We're all okay.
And no idea what caused it?	But they're gonna run a whole series of tests, so.
What other matter?	An unrelated family matter.
They need probable cause.	"Probable cause?" Yo, what'd you do? Rob a bank?
God, Badger! Don't mess with me! Got it?	I got it.
My God. Okay, that's all of it.	This is a bad choice.
You sure about this guy?	He's totally, totally cool. He's my cousin.
Yo, what'd we say, 500?	We didn't say, and it's 1,000.
$1,000? C'mon, where you towing it, man, Seattle?	It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.
That right? You a "stand-up dude?"	Yeah, I am. I will get you the other $500.
What's the last thing you remember?	I was driving home. I think.
Yeah, we're looking really good.	Thank God. So, what was it, then?
That may still be a ways down the road.	"A ways down the road?"
Three days, you must have got hungry.	Yeah, I guess.
Why didn't you answer your cell phone?	It was in my car.
Like what, like, like this?	That's not mine.
The kid with the crutches. The football player.	How about we stay on topic?
Buenas tardes, seï¿½or Salamanca. ï¿½Entiendes en inglï¿½s?	What's that mean?
Did he mention my name?	No, thanks for caring.
And the RV?	Badger's cousin took it to his garage. It's safe.
So we can cook.	So you still wanna cook? Seriously?
What's changed, Jesse?	737,000. 21 pounds, minus cash on hand...cash on hand.
Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?	No, I was awake.
You sneaky bastard, you!	Very nice work.
You shouldn't have. You sick, sick puppies. I love it!	You going to finish your apple juice?
But I'm not thirsty.	Dad. Drink it.
You got a better idea?	Okay, fine. Whatever. So when do we, you know?
In the kitchen.	I didn't know you were allowed to touch the stove.
I wanted to. Grapefruit juice?	Yes, please. Thanks.
There you go. Honey?	I'll stick with orange, thank you.
You wouldn't know any current bands.	That's besides the point.
Boz Scaggs. There's another one.	Whoever they are. Thanks for breakfast.
Wait. What? You're kicking me out of my own house?	It's your aunt Ginny's house.
She gave it to me.	She never gave it to you, Jesse.
What happened is you're a speed manufacturer.	No, I'm not. What?
I think that's great.	Jesse. Jesse. Hey, Jesse. You don't answer your phone?
No, Mom! Mom! Where am I supposed to go?	I don't know, sweetheart. But please turn your life around.
Yeah, this is gonna help big time with that! Bitch!	Oh, hey, Mr. White.
New Mexican Christmas style, red and green chilies.	No. Thank you, though. Flynn and me gotta get going.
What's wrong with Walter Jr?	Don't take it personally. He wants his own identity.
You think he told Louis about me? About the blackout?	Louis is his friend, Walt, and your disappearance upset him.
I made omelets.	I'm going out, but thanks, though.
Where are you going?	Can you get the phone, please?
Yeah. Absolutely. White residence.	Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?
What part of "no contact" didn't you understand?	I know but there's a problem.
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic out there female-wise.	Damn. I'm hating, man.
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.	Hey, Ben, I think it's someone's nap time. Come on.
What the hell you doing here? You smell like shit.	It's a long story.
So ask me.	Why? Would you even tell me?
Are you actually this stupid?	No, look. I know this isn't optimal...
So, we're not going through an insurer. Is that correct?	Yes. Direct bill.
Just need to print it out for you.	Thank you. I thought we had discussed a cash discount.
No. The hospital bill came.	That was fast.
I'm surprised his head still fits through the door.	Hey, wanna grab lunch?
Here's the man.	Hey, congratulations, Hank.
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.	What about that one?
Utilities are included.	Stacking. Sweet. You got cable?
What are you doing?	brat' off. What's it look
Okay, so what's the plan?	The plan is we cook.
I got bills, man.	You've got bills?
There's a third way.	And what would that be?
You don't get to vote.	I beg your pardon? This is a partnership, remember?
Good deal, mover. Good deal.	Yo. Badge, hey.
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.	Nah. They burn in, yo.
It's gonna be pretty much sparse. Very Asian-y, modern stuff.	Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
You got any other refreshments?	I could kick it. It's been a while.
That's kinda, like, hopeful, bro.	Street's maybe 17, 18.
It's an armpit.	It's not an armpit.
You know perfectly well, Marie.	Well, obviously I don't.
Hell, yeah, it was freakin' scary, you little punk. Jesus.	But you were way faster than him.
Well, I'm here, aren't I?	Hell, yeah. Kick ass and take names.
I wasn't sure it was you. New car?	Yeah, keeping things on the D.L.
I'm guessing this one doesn't bounce.	Your half. That's what I'm talking about. You're welcome. Jesus.
What up? Damn, bitch.	Got something for me?
Yeah, I found them.	Is this a 5 or an S?
5. No, wait. S. Yeah, a 5.	Jesus, how the hell do you spell "street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?
I think it's gonna be a nice day, huh?	Yeah, high 70s.
You have a great day.	Right on. You too.
You dropped it!	Shut the hell up about it.
Very nice to meet you, Flynn.	Nice to meet you, too.
Though a bald head is a bit of a shocker.	I know it was for me.
For good luck. Right?	Exactly. Here's hoping. We could use some of that, huh?
Nice meeting you.	Likewise. Bye now.
I just want to say, man...	What? What do you want to say?
Serious, I might have a concussion!	Don't fall asleep, baby.
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.	You shut up!
Shut up, skank.	Shut up! Stop it!
So? It's FIDC insured. It's a victimless crime.	Where the hell did you get this?
I'm telling you. A victimless crime.	Jesus! Come on already!
Stop calling me that! I ain't no skank!	Skank, skank, skank ass skank!
And I apologize deeply.	Now please tell me why you did it.
You are always the picture of innocence.	You left me.
They're cutting off the money.	What did she say, exactly?
And yet she still drives a Bentley.	Keeping up appearances or I don't know. Who knows?
Baby, that H is bringing me down.	You took too much. I told you.
And you knocked, right? He didn't answer? Which means?	Look, I'm his father, all right?
You're Mr. Jackson?	That's me. Walt Jackson. And you are?
I called the cops.	You called the cops?
It's Badger, man.	What are you doing? Don't use your real name.
You get on. All right? I just want to forget.	Sorry. What's up with that?
It ain't real, dumbass.	Watch it, is all.
Man, that's church, yo. For real.	What have you heard?
Serious. But, like he really did it?	You didn't hear that from me.
Wow, handsome. Oh, my God. Good genes.	Speaking of movie stars, those can't be the twins.
Walt, how's he doing?	He is doing great. He's plugging away.
You're kidding. You were like our go-to bookkeeper.	The economy, you know, so.
Because it's not our territory.	Because we lack initiative.
I'm a blowfish.	You are a blowfish. Say it again.
I'm a blowfish.	Say it like you mean it.
We'll get you three.	You give me ten.
Speak of the devil.	How are you? What's up?
This is Raisin Bran, not Raisin Bran Crunch.	So? Same thing.
Dad, notice anything?	Is there a funeral today?
A funeral? Christ, do I look that bad?	Mom got a job.
Corner the market, then raise the price. Simple economics.	Come on in.
I figured that might be a deal-breaker.	Listen, I wanted to thank you for having me back.
You don't have to thank me. I need you.	It's a little early for wine, isn't it?
All right. I'm hitting it.	You dudes give up that easy?
Which dude? That dude? No way. He'd kick my ass.	True that. This is so hard, you know?
So go ahead and ask.	Are you a cop?
Not like that. Ask it, like, official.	Are you a police officer?
I was out partying, minding my own business.	You are under arrest.
I really need to get some furniture.	I suggest you start with a bed.
God, I wish we could smoke in here.	Well, you can't.
What'd I say?	Nothing. I just have to go is all.
I just think it's asking a lot.	He knows it. He's done nothing but apologize.
Baby, not now.	It's me, Hank. Sorry.
Hey, buddy. What's up?	I just, do you mind if I...So how you doing?
Playing it by ear. "To be determined."	Think you might want to talk it through with somebody?
Do it again. Go on.	$10,000 even. Same as last time. It's totally accurate.
Not yours, I take it.	We got 10, 20, 30, 44, five each.
Then wake him up. He can sleep after we're paid.	Why you gotta be such a hard on?
Honey, I'm home! Too slow! What's up?	You've got more lives than a damn cat.
We are hanging out, Badger. You like Badger or Brandon?	I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution.
And Badger's gonna spill?	Like the Exxon Valdez.
So what do we do about it?	Francesca, how about I follow you home?
Wait a minute. This is in regards to what's-his-name?	Badger! Brandon Mayhew.
He just goes by Heisenberg.	How old's this Heisenberg?
Average, I guess. Medium height, medium weight.	What color hair?
There's more than one kind of prison.	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Wait a minute.	What? What? Let me see. Who the hell is that?
I don't know.	Mr. Heisenberg, I presume. Time to move?
Not till we see the exchange.	What? Now he shows.
I don't get it. What's the holdup?	Where's the stuff, man?
Where are we going?	Just shut up. Get out. Go stop him.
Schrader, I'm blocked.	Not a good time.
How you doing? Are you feeling okay?	Schrader, I'm blocked.
We're working. You gotta get out of here.	You're working? Like DEA working? Is something going down?
Wrong guy! Wrong guy! Other bench.	Move your ass now!
Okay. I'll go and leave you alone.	We'll talk about it later. Just floor it! Floor it!
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?	I'm no Vito Corleone.
You all right in there? You okay?	I'm fine, thank you.
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.	How much time they giving you?
At this time, $16,000.	How long have you been doing this?
Who is it?	Boy, you need some educating.
Hold on, hold on. Sorry. One sec. What?	I've been trying to reach you. Where's your drop phone?
I've been busy.	Clear your social calendar. We have to cook.
Tuesday? Four days straight?	Like it or not, we have no choice.
And why, exactly, is that?	Our methylamine. It's going bad.
All right, all right. Go.	I wish you didn't have to do this.
Three entire bags of Funyuns?	What? Funyuns are awesome.
How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh?	Man, I'm getting no service.
How are you even alive?	Yo, check your phone. You get any bars?
I've got a signal.	Let me use yours, would ya?
Oh, God. Not there. That is our work station.	Our work station.
You said raise the prices.	All right, that's 40 times 42, minus distribution charges.
Six hundred and...	Seventy-two thousand dollars each.
I left 'em right here in the ignition.	Son of a bitch.
That is not what happened.	How do you know?
About another 15 miles.	Really? That far?
I'm trying to trickle-charge the battery.	Seriously? Just by turning that thing?
It has to work. You understand?	Can I try? How much longer?
I don't know.	You hanging in?
Do you have any money? Change, I mean. Coins.	I got a bunch of them.
A battery. Move!	This doesn't look like any battery I ever saw.
Sorry, buddy. No can do.	My son! My bottle! My house!
It's all right.	What are you waiting for? Bring it back.
You want me to go back to bed?	I guess that'd be kind of...
Need some help?	I got it. Just have a seat.
Is there any coffee?	Yeah, shit. One second.
I can tell. Fork?	There you go.
But we're really optimistic.	Great. Good news is great.
Yeah, it is. It really is.	Feel free to bring these any time.
You want installation, right?	No. I'm gonna do it myself.
That's what I like to hear.	And who's this? This guy can surf without a board?
Shut up. Like you never wanted a superpower.	Is that your door or mine?
I don't know.	It sounds like mine. I gotta go.
Hey. This your dad?	This is the new tenant.
Son, about yesterday...	I'm sorry about the pool.
I have some tools to put away.	You want to catch a movie later? What?
Before. With your dad.	It wasn't about anything.
So I totally just misread your total dis?	If anything, I was doing you a favor.
I bought a filter.	And I figured the less he knows, the better.
That's all you think you're doing?	Why do you even care about my dad?
You and me.	Who's you and me?
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.	I don't really see anything.
Not if I can help it.	You bucking for a promotion? Go home already.
I guess it just doesn't feel any different.	The good news?
Are you going to work today?	Skyler, there's rot.
You don't have to do that.	You're buying the wrong matches.
There he is. That's the guy.	Stay out of my territory.
When's the due date?	It's the 21st.
Which one is he?	You did not just say that to me.
You said expand the territory!	That doesn't mean you become careless!
We're in the big time now. So where's the kingpin?	Your guess is as good as mine.
That's why I left 40 minutes early.	Sorry. What did I miss?
For your refrigerator.	Oh, my God. Look at her. Look. God.
Isn't that Friday the 13th?	We have a birthday.
You cannot deny your employer his birthday wish.	Yes, I can. Watch me.
He wasn't there.	He was there all right.
Call him back.	I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Diet Coke, please. And five minutes of your time.	What can I do for you?
Are you familiar with my product?	I've been told it's excellent.
I like to mix some ice with it. Hold that.	What's it feel like?
Excuse me, where's the manager?	I'm the manager. Can I help you?
Where is it? Where'd you hide the meth?	In the kitchen.
Are you okay? Is everything okay?	Everything's okay. I just wish you'd been here.
What about that guy next door?	What do you mean?
Oh, hi, Carmen. Just Carmen.	Come on. Hurry up.
That baby's hungry.	Give me that baby. Aw, sweetie. Come on.
Jeez, Sky. Not at the table. We're eating.	Hank, it's only a breast.
It's my sister-in-law's breast.	You are so provincial.
I wish. Mom's even talking about me getting a job.	That's right. Everybody pitches in.
Hammacher Schlemmer makes a proper one of those. It's hypo-allergenic.	I think a towel will do. What is it?
Your son. He's just unbelievable. Come see what he did.	I told you it's not ready yet.
Honey, just show it to them.	My God, son. That's wonderful.
I don't understand why you need him.	Exactly. My point exactly.
Dad, let him go!	Get away from me, man. Back off. Back off!
You miserable little smackhead. Get the hell out!	Hey, I pay my rent, bitch! I got civil rights!
Jesse, come on. Please, no. Come on.	I pay my rent.
What are you doing? What are you doing?	I am calling the police.
I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Tomorrow.	You meant all that?
Just let it ring.	No, I'm gonna go see who it is.
Oh, of course. It really has been a long time.	Jesus. Get somewhere you can talk.
You wouldn't really go to the cops, would you?	We won't have to. He'll pay.
I guess you don't.	You'll never hear from either of us again.
You're not seeing straight, Jesse. You are making a mistake.	Do you know what this is?
Is New Zealand part of Australia?	New Zealand is New Zealand.
We can do that. Definitely.	Excuse me. What can I get you?
To water on Mars.	So, what'd you have? Girl or boy?
A little girl.	That's nice. Congratulations. I have a daughter.
You have other kids?	Just the one.
You all right?	Flynn, get your butt in here.
Look right there. Look at that.	Are those donations?
April 4, 1982.	And mother's maiden name and place of birth.
I don't believe it. Walt, you have to see this!	40 from Terre Haute.
Because maybe your Heisenberg's in prison.	So says APD. They think they got their man.
Awesome. It'll mean more hits.	And more contributions.
Nice to meet you.	Nice to meet you.
Paul Canterna of Canterna Real Estate.	It's a pleasure.
Good to meet you.	And Gustavo Fring of Los Pollos Hermanos.
Please, just Gus.	Got to tell you, you guys make some kill
No. That's my brother-in-law. He's got a health issue.	I'm very sorry. What sort of health issue?
You don't have to do that.	Please. I'm happy to do it.
He is. He's the best.	You don't want to lose him, do you, Walter?
None of us do. We love him.	He's a good man, isn't he?
Yes, ma'am. Totally. My dad is my hero.	Does that put him to sleep?
They'll probably want me to take your glasses.	Yeah, you better.
She's seven weeks tomorrow. Seven, right?	I have a picture here, somewhere.
Shortness of breath?	A bit, but much better.
But he can be on his own? Just more, independent.	Use your best judgment.
Yes. For the last few weeks.	With whom? Who am I having an affair with?
Well, I mean, he certainly knows we're separated, so.	Has he moved out?
Half a million in cash.	That's the spirit. I got it, I got it.
I'll take you to school.	Yeah. No, I'm ready now.
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.	All right, I'm here. See you soon.
So, like, what makes you the expert?	I don't think I ever said I was that.
What the hell's going on in there?	Good morning, officer.
Citing you, sir.	What? What, you don't believe me?
I asked you to stay in the vehicle.	I can get out of my own car.
Take a deep breath, calm down.	This is America, okay?
Step back now.	Did you even hear what I said?
Sir, calm down.	Hellfire rained down on my house where my children sleep!
No, doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.	Why'd the Border Patrol kick this to us?
Hey, Dad. Fixing up the house, huh?	Doing a little work, yeah.
Well, I'll bounce. It's cool.	You doing okay?
She doesn't want me to see the kids.	She said that?
God. It's a disaster.	It is not a disaster.
Oh, my God.	Talk to our friend and get cooking.
Pop-pop! Pop-pop, the ice cream man!	Don't tell your mom.
You want a job?	A job? Who's got a job for me?
Hey. Hey. Thought I'd well visit, if you don't mind.	Of course not. You don't need the room, do you?
Is that right?	If you're gonna do this, it can't be so glaring.
Well, it's not about taking sides, though.	How can you let her treat you like this?
You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?	Better call Saul! I get it all the time.
We feel 875 is very fair.	But I suppose there's always a little wiggle room.
No, that's my offer.	That's less than half-price.
Four hundred thousand. That's my final offer.	Waste of time.
I got dipping sticks.	You've reached Walt's temporary number. Please, leave a message.
Oh, no. Oh, God. This is all we need.	Hey, Mom, Dad. How's it going?
Inside. I bought the place.	It's me. There's something he should know about.
Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me.	What? What the hell are you doing in there?
What is wrong with you?	Skyler, I have every right to be here.
Hey, son. How are you?	Are you back for good?
How was school?	It was good.
Not really? What does that mean?	So are you gonna be at work tomorrow?
Yeah, that's the plan.	Hello, ma'am. We were called about a disturbance?
Sure, man. Whatever.	Okay. Whatever what? I mean, you gonna call him?
Indeed, he is.	So you're in business with this Heisenberg.
My husband makes meth. Methamphetamine.	Your husband's a drug dealer?
What are you talking about?	Ain't jack going on up here. It's quiet as hell.
What you doing?	Calling A.P.D. What do you think?
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.	Where you going?
Gotta take a leak.	Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.
There's an ATM right outside.	Yeah, I don't have a card.
So how does it feel? Does it hurt?	Yeah, it's tight.
Yeah, but is it painful?	It's hard to breathe.
You know what? You called my bluff.	What does that even mean?
Just keep telling yourself that.	What is that supposed to mean?
It's a bad thing.	Hello. Walter White to see Ted Beneke.
I'm sorry. Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.	Okay. I will wait.
Excuse me. Mr. Beneke's not available.	Ted? Come on.
We have a situation.	Walt. Walt. Walt. What are you doing?
Great, drilled right into the stucco.	A little bit of putty, you'll be fine.
Great line of work, by the way. Real upstanding field.	Yeah, well I enjoy it.
No, I moved back home.	That's good, right?
No, this is fine.	So I want an intro to your guy.
Yeah, well, sorry. I can't help you.	Fine, ass-wad. I'll contact the guy myself.
Anytime, loser. Hey, hey, hey! Wait. Hey!	00. This day is dragging.
Okay. I wish I could stay.	So stay. What's stopping you?
I can't believe I remembered that.	Mel who? Does he have a last name?
Do the deal.	You have one unheard message.
Where can I find him, you think?	No idea. Haven't seen him.
Where did this come from, Cara?	I don't know. What is it? Drugs?
Cara. Please, tell me that that camera works.	Damn it. Bingo.
Work it, work it, baby.	Yo, this is sick, brother.
Must be moving mad volume.	It's funny. You wanna know what's funny?
Why don't you go get your dad?	Sure. Hey, Dad. Dad?
What did I just say?	Give me the phone. Give it.
Whatever, man. You owe me that money.	Let me talk to him.
I turned it down. End of story.	Good. Good. Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.
What is this?	Your new lab.
All right, rain check, then.	Great dinner, Mom. Can I be excused?
To do homework or to play video games?	I can multitask.
Could you check again?	Now? Can I do it after the party?
Janice, I'm dead in the water here.	Okay, I'll check.
I'd really like to speak with him.	He's passed away. He was shit two months
Christian Ortega. Was his nickname Combo?	Thanks for this. I really appreciate it.
Miss Peyketewa, she's dead! I need some backup out here.	Okay. On their way.
My unhappiness? My completely out-of-the-clear blue-sky unhappiness? Really?	Look, as you said, for the best.
Brandon Mayhew. I know you. Small world, Albuquerque.	Wanna talk about it?
Oh, yes. Hi. Sorry. I'll be right down.	Hi. Gale Boetticher.
"X-ray crystallography." Really? I could talk about that for hours.	I would love to.
Exactly. But actually, I prefer ether.	Oh, I'll have it for tomorrow.
Gale, I'm wondering how youï¿½	Ended up here?
It is. It is magic. It still is.	"When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer."
Well, can you recite it?	Pathetically enough, I could.
Marie, I'm working.	Did you find it? The RV?
No. Working on it, soï¿½	Why can't you just arrest him, make him tell you?
It's not simple. There's a thing called the Constitution.	Constitution, blah, blah, blah.
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey, how you doing?	Oh, hey, Hank. What's up?
Yo. What, Mr. White?	How's my favorite genius?
Socket wrench. The big one.	What? You scared of the Arabs?
Hey, what about Jesse?	What about him?
He was just having fun. You'll get over it.	No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!
I guess crime does pay.	I don't suppose you just came by to insult me.
Clean, no moisture. Done.	Is our solvent filtered?
I thought you might ask that. Done.	That's good. That's good.
Gale. What temperature did you set here?	Here? Station five, 75 C.
I said 85. 85.	I wrote it down. You said 75. I wrote it.
I look like a TV weatherman.	You want a coffee?
He attacked me?	He swung at you with something.
Swung at me?	He attacked you with a pipe.
I don't think you heard-	I heard you fine. I said no.
Hank, you don't have to do this.	No, I do. I'm good.
They're approaching your car. You have one minute.	I don't get the gag, jagoff. Who is this?
So roll me further, bitch.	What's coming? Male, Caucasian.
BP is 70.	Seven-zero over palp.
Weak and thready at the brachial.	No breath sounds on the right side, belly is rigid.
Appears pale and diaphoretic.	How many entry wounds? Four.
Shoulder and hip, through and through.	Right lung in lower left quadrant, no visible exit wounds.
Let's get him 2 grams of oxygen.	What's his haemoglobin? - Seven-point-three.
Notify the OR, we are on the way.	OR 1 is clear.
Let's put him in there.	Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.
Damn, brother, look at you.	That's messed up.
How are you feeling? You okay? Actually I'm great.	I don't understand.
I thought things were going pretty well.	I thought we were kind of simpatico.
You know? We were becoming a real team.	Not Not so much, no.
You said you liked the configuration.	And I do.
For the most part.	Look, you're a fine chemist, really, with a promising future.
What's up, partner? - I can't believe this.	My replacement? Oh, Jesus.
Nice to meet you.	What's up? Man.
We should've ditched that RV months ago.	It's all, like, shiny up in here.
Makes no sense.	So I guess this is Oh, dear mother of God.
This is for the best.	Two hundred pounds a week.
Okay, there's a lot to show you.	Some new techniques to learn.
Femur's like a wet bag of gravel.	Other one's not much better.
Get those boots off.	See if you get a pulse.
Get blood-pressure cup or an ABI? Where's that blood? Dr.	Bording to Cardiology.
I'm so sorry.	I'm so sorry, honey.
I'm so sorry.	I don't know what to say.
How is he? - I don't know.	They won't really tell us anything.
He's still in surgery.	They shit him four
Hey, how are you, huh? - Fine.	Yeah? Sure? I'm fine.
Probably Mexican nationals.	Their tattoos indicated an affiliation with the drug cartel.
They had an axe.	The cartels tend to be dramatic.
That means I had to take away his	You had to take it.
It's standard procedure.	No one - Okay.
And he would've had a gun and could've defended	Marie, let's just - No.
Just It's their fault.	He didn't have a
I mean it.	Sorry - Go.
You are not welcome here.	The DEA is not welcome here.
It's not just them.	It's you, Walt.
It's all right.	All right, you're done.
Yo, yo, yo.	Jesse Pinkman in the house.
Oh, my dear God.	Walter White to the nearest courtesy phone.
Dude, it's not my schedule.	We have responsibilities here.
I'll get there when I get there.	You know what? Whatever.
I'll just cook on my own.	You will do no such thing.
Jesse, touch nothing.	Stop treating me lik e I'm lik e your assistant.
We really do appreciate that.	What, is your wife there? Yes.
Yes, she is.	She would be happy to know you asked about her.
This fork is absolutely filthy.	Tell me you see this.
You've got good eyes.	Look at that.
Those are not "water spots.	" That's dirt.
This silverware's obviously not been cleaned.	It's covered in germs from someone else's mouth.
God knows what.	Seriously, Aunt Marie, it's water spots.
Ours at home aren't any better.	Yours at home are irrelevant.
We're in a hospital.	They need to be a higher standard.
It's in the same building.	It's all under the same roof.
Lying there, waiting for them to anesthetise you.	Knowing that you may never wake up again.
Anyway, there we are.	We're driving up Central and we hit every green light.
I had that.	Anyway, I survived this place.
Your man is in custody.	God bless America! He's innocent until proven guilty.
We're gonna have to wait for him to stabilize.	How long will that take? I can't really say.
Hey, guys, this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.	Good to meet you.
We were just swapping Hank stories.	That could go on all day.
God knows, there's a million of them.	Meanwhile - Miserable piece of shit.
Guy who shit him, one that's left, he's up	Got the kill going on, resting
Your tax dollars at work.	Gotta see what Hank did to that bastard.
This is Walter White.	I'll connect you.
Yo, we got problems, big ones.	Reverend, so nice of you to call.
You know, I will definitely look into that.	I'll tell you what.
Apparently I'm not worthy of meeting him.	The other one.
The one I'm qualified to speak to.	He started asking questions too.
Lik e why haven't we cook ed anything.	All right, we have a quota.
Oh, I think I'm gonna go wash my face.	I'm going crazy.
Do you wanna come? - Yeah.	Nurse Franklin, please page the operator.
Nurse Franklin, page the operator.	I got candy bars.
Is this what you were asking for? - Yeah.	Yeah? Yeah, I skimmed through it.
No, I assure you.	We are hard at work.
It has my total attention.	We'll cook through week end if necessary.
We will have 400 pounds for you by next week.	I have your word on that? You do.
You have my word on that.	Thank you for the update.
Owner's a big booster for the DEA.	He heard what happened.
I don't even know what to say.	That's an incredible - Good, huh? - Delicious.
That's so generous of you.	Thank you very much.
Yes, thank you.	Guys, did you hear that? Mr.
I only wish I could do more.	Well, we do appreciate your support.
This reward could turn the tide here.	It'll really help.
Again, I can't express how sorry I am.	As it happens, I actually met Agent Schrader.
Fring was one of our sponsors.	I talked for a few minutes with your husband.
As a matter of fact, Mr.	White, your name came up.
Things have improved, yes.	That's wonderful to hear.
Thank you again very much.	It was a great pleasure to meet you.
Let me walk you out.	Oh, no, it's not necessary.
You know, I didn't say thank you.	I'll walk him out.
Be right back.	Good to see you.
It's my pleasure.	May I? May I speak with you? Just a moment.
I am told the assassin that survived is gravely injured.	It's doubtful he'll live.
Thank you again.	You're quite welcome, Mr.
What's going on? What's happening? Starting chest compressions.	One, two, three, four.
One, two, three - Defib? Patient is in asystole.	Continuing chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.	Give me a litre of saline.
I can't get a pulse.	One, two, three, four.
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.	Yes? Juan? I assume you heard the news.
I see things clear enough.	One DEA gets shot, all of Washington starts
I always do.	My brother's a police chief.
I got connections.	They'll get me through.
But don't tak e my word for it.	One taste and you'll know.
Better over than under.	Over by a pound and a half.
We'll just save it out till next week.	We ship it as is.
What, are we running a charity? Come on, man.	We're gonna take it out.
You are paid extraordinarily well.	Why can't you just appreciate that? - Yeah.
Hey, I been crunching numbers.	Oh, you've been crunching numbers? - Yeah.
All right, look, say he's getting 40 a pound.	All right, 200 pounds a week for three months.
Ninety-six million dollars.	Ninety-six million dollars.
All right? Ninety-six million.	Ninety-six to our three.
That is messed up, yo.	That is so messed up.
Is it okay if I visit? Yeah.	His colour looks good.
Gomey, is that you? Buddy, yeah, it's me.	That's you, Gomey? Yeah, Hank.
Hey, check this out.	I got something that'll make you feel better.
Been keeping an eye on that blue meth of yours.	Six, seven weeks, nothing.
Then all of a sudden, boom, it's popping up everywhere.	Look at the new locations.
Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.	Even right here in town.
A teener here and there, you know, strictly street-level amounts.	Man, it's crazy.
Well, three cheers for me.	This thing doesn't do a damn thing.
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.	It's been an hour, right? I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.	I'll go find somebody.
I didn't see it coming.	What? Damn right, you did.
No, I didn't see shit.	Day late and dollar short, as usual.
A voice scrambler.	Could have been anybody.
Are you safe? Absolutely.	Jesse? Jesse? What about you? Face looks better.
Got a job.	Job is good.
It's in a Laundromat.	It's totally corporate.
All kinds of red tape.	My boss is a dick.
You've got all these nice tulips and baby's breath.	Oh, and this is chrysanthemum.
Look at these, Hank.	Aren't they beautiful? - Beautiful.
Wow, look at the size of this basket.	It's got so many goodies in it.
Boss hall of fame.	I don't see anything here from Kleinman.
They're gonna have to get on the stick.	How's everybody doing today? - Good.
Moment of truth? Yeah, I wouldn't call it that.	All right, let's just take a look here.
Oh, I don't know.	Four? - Okay, four.
It looks like some ne function is returning.	Oh, thank God.
And even then, the odds, they're not great.	But you can't know for sure.
Certainly by early next week.	Next week? No, that's not gonna do it.
Actually, she asked the doctor.	Plan-wise, four treatments a week is fairly typical.
Is the health plan's way medically justifiable? Sure.	Is it absolutely optimal? You know, screw it.
I'll make sure he gets what he needs.	They can reimburse me.
Really, I do.	But my best advice is stay in the network.
Don't go out of pocket.	Physical therapy is just the beginning.
To hell with the plan.	There he is.
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.	He's in for the full treatment.
Look around, kiddo.	It's all yours.
What? - This? - Yeah.	You are now the owner of this fine establishment.
For free? - Free? Oh, ladies, cover your ears.	No, not free.
Here's you, right? Pink, Pinkman.	Get it? Okay, here's your cash.
You're out on the town.	Yeah, you're partying hearty.
You're knocking boots with the chicky babes.	Oh, who's this? It's the tax man.
Million times worse.	You're a tax cheat.
Now, you give me your money, okay? That's called placement.	Hand me that little thing Bin.
Final step, integration.	The revenues from the salon go to the owner.
No, that's 17 percent.	I heard you say 5.
You said it right in front of me.	Yeah, that was for your partner.
Listen to reason.	How is your brother-in-law? He'll live.
We're both adults.	I can't pretend I don't know that person is you.
I want there to be no confusion.	I know I owe you my life.
And more than that I respect the strategy.	In your position I would have done the same.
I want security for my family.	Then you have it.
Three million for three months.	That was our agreement.
Extended annually, 12 million a year.	Call it 15.
Free licence to bitch and moan.	How often do you get that?
Forget about money. Assume you have all you want.	I don't know. I guess I would make something.
What happened to the box?	I gave it to my mom.
You know, I didn't give the box to my mom.	I traded it for an ounce of weed.
He's a hero.	You don't deny coverage to a hero.
They'll say they're not denying coverage.	No, no, I'm agreeing with you.
I wanna be there in case he wakes up.	With all they're giving him, he'll sleep till morning.
Oh, you're Ted.	I've heard so much about you.
Thank you for your gift basket.	That was really thoughtful.
Would you like a glass? No, no, thanks.	I'm just on my way home.
I just thought I'd You know, I am really	I think I'm gonna take that bath.
Bad idea to come here.	Ted, I'm I'll see you in a day or two.
Back at the office.	Take as much time as you want.
I can't believe you had to crush the RV.	Must've been, like, depressing.
No one misses it more than me.	Free to cook anytime, anywhere.
All right? Let's start slinging again.	Let's do it.
Life's too short, I say.	Hells yeah, bitches.
We don't need no RV.	All we need is a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles.
Where's your self-respect? Come on.	Ain't top-shelf, but we could at least move it.
Still kind of dry out there.	It'll sell on the street.
I see a couple new faces.	Anybody wanna introduce themselves? Don't all speak at once.
I didn't raise my hand.	No, go ahead.
This is what we do.	Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.
You had it too? - Yeah, bro.	I wish I never even heard of it.
That's the shame of it.	No, no, man.
Don't tell me that.	I hear it's back in town.
It's gonna be okay.	I swear to God, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.	I'll go to 48 Hours.
I'll go to Nightline.	Don't know if there's Nightline anymore.
We can always pay their bills.	Please, it's tens of thousands of dollars.
We have the money, more than enough.	Walt earned it.
Skyler, I really don't think this is a good idea.	I think that - He earned it gambling.
Walt and I we've had our problems lately.	You know that.
And what it all came down to really was money.	Pure and simple.
It was more than facing death.	It was knowing that he was gonna leave behind nothing.
And so that's how this all started.	For better or worse he wanted to provide.
Yeah, I thought so too.	The truth is he never took their money.
Was that some sort of cover? - No, no.	He did not fake that, Marie.
He couldn't live with it.	He was suicidal.
No more gambling.	But we have the money.
How much money? Walt? Well it's into seven figures.	Holy Mary, mother of God.
What can I say? I did very well.	Marie you will take our money.
Marie, let us help.	Does Walt, Jr.
Know about this? - Absolutely not.	And I need to keep it that way.
Yeah, I Yeah, I just I need to Yeah, okay.	We'll talk about it later.
And I'm not forgetting that.	Surprised he doesn't make us do that.
The pack totally has a pecking order.	And the head hyena, he's the man, you know.
All the other ones have to, like, kiss his ass.	I mean, literally.
It's so gross.	They have to lick his junk.
And water boys, you know? Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.	Get us a couple flunkies in here.
Treat us right.	Okay, 15 hours starts now.
I'm gonna hit it, if that's cool with you.	I don't understand.
Dude's totally boning us.	No, it's not that.
Nothing gets spilled.	A little maybe.
Nothing gets spilled.	What about evaporation? It wouldn't account for this much.
Yeah, why? Nothing.	Are you coming? Yeah, in a minute.
Son of a Come on, you Come on, come on.	Son of a Come on.
Shut the door! - My ears are popping.	Shut the door.
What the hell's doing that? Positive pressure.	Positive what? God, it frigging kill,
Well, just move your jaw around.	I am moving it around.
It's not working.	Just yawn or something.
What positive? Positive what? Pressure.	I've turned the ventilation up to keep the outside out.
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa.	Hey, hold up.
Something got into the lab.	So, what do we do? I mean, do we? Wait.
So it's, like, not dangerous? Mr.	White, talk to me here.
Not to us particularly, no.	What the hell is that? This is I made it.
I'm trying to get it out.	Okay? Understand? No, man, not really.
It's a problem.	It's a contamination.
"Clear the contaminant.	" We're making meth here, all right? Not space shuttles.
But you are right.	We're running out of time.
We probably have the most un-picky customers in the world.	No, no, no.
No harm done.	Then we're golden.
It stays closed.	That's an order.
What does it matter? Who cares? I got it.	Oh, Jesus, seriously? - Where is it? It's right there.
See? I told you I got it.	This is a raisin.
Look, I definitely got it, man, all ri Oh, man.	He's got some kill,
Failing that we're dead.	There is no more room for error.
Then come back down here and subtract his ass.	Oh, wait, do you have your keys? - Yeah.
It's a real one.	Yeah, like yours was working.
No, no, no.	Look, we're trying to decontaminate.
I got a butt-Ioad.	We hang them up all over the place.
It won't be able to resist.	I sure hope we have enough.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say yeah.	Do you see him?
How long do you think you've been awake?	Why do you keep asking me that?
How about it? Yeah.	You take cream and sugar? - Black is fine.
It was a possum.	Big freaky-Iooking bitch.
I mean, why they gotta go changing everything? Whatever.	It's just big rats anyways.
Giant pink-tailed rats with their pink rat faces.	Totally freaky, like alien rats.
That's what they do.	I mean, they play dead or whatever.
It was Scrabble.	Yeah, that was it.
" She got like that toward the end.	Got obsessive about stuff.
Just got mad about stuff.	We didn't know what was up.
You know, got her some treatment.	Meds, so she wasn't stressing all the time.
It was a lot better after that.	You know, she was a lot happier.
And plus, my daughter wasn't born yet.	It had to be after Holly was born.
I mean, how could I possibly? I know the moment.	It was the night Jane died.
But afterward, I stopped at a bar.	It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.	I just walked in, sat down.
He's a complete stranger.	But he turns out to be Jane's father, Donald Margolis.
I mean, think of the odds.	Once I tried to calculate them, but they're astronomical.
"Never give up on family.	" And I didn't.
I took his advice.	The universe is random.
It's not inevitable.	It's simple chaos.
It's subatomic particles in endless aimless collision.	That's what science teaches us.
It was some Some nature programme about elephants.	And Skyler and Holly were in another room.
I could hear them on the baby monitor.	She was singing a lullaby.
Must be Thailand-hot up there.	That's why he likes it.
Thailand's hot, right? Yeah.	Then that's why.
It's not your fault.	It's not mine either.
It's no one's fault, not even hers.	You know, we are who we are, Mr.
I'm so close.	Let it go.
We need to cook.	What about the contamination? It's all contaminated.
All right, well I definitely scared him.	Probably stay out of our way.
Yeah! Somebody got got, yo! Did you see that, Mr.	Wh? Bins are packed? Bins are packed.
How's the yield? Two-oh-two and change.	You okay getting home? Yeah.
Jesse, come here.	I couldn't chance saying it inside.
For all I know, the lab's wired for sound.	That half a pound I said we were off by.
Who's asking you to?	Yo, I thought I was gonna see some, like, vaginas.
I didn't say she actually painted vaginas.	I said, some of her paintings looked like vaginas.
Seriously? Not even close.	Georgia O'Keeffe painted all kinds of stuff.
Everyday items, her surroundings.	Some of it evoked an erotic nature.
It's who she was.	Not like any vagina I ever saw.
It was the same subject, but different every time.	The light was different, her mood was different.
That door was her home and she loved it.	To me, that's about making that feeling last.
All right, here we go.	You ready? Come on, give me a step.
Nope, that's it.	Take me up.
You can do this, Hank.	Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
Pain is weakness leaving your body.	Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.
Lf you can get your leg up, go for it.	Take me up.
Never mind about your coffee break.	Take me up.
We'll just pick up where we left off.	Come on, Hank.
It's all right.	I'll be right back, okay? Be right back.
Just say the words.	You think I'm stealing.
Say whatever's on your mind.	How about you? You wanna start us off? Yeah.
One teenth? That's it? - Yeah.	To who? To him.
It's not easy selling to these people.	They're trying to better themselves.
You know what? I want it back.	All of it.
I'll sell it myself.	Come on, man.
It's not so easy like you think.	I will show you exactly how easy it is.
See you next week.	Oh, hey, sorry.
No, go ahead.	Andrea, right? - Yeah.
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner? No.	Your dad is.
Hey, so check it out.	See what that means? Check out the date.
You don't turn 16 for two more months.	It doesn't matter, it's a provisional.
Look it up.	They changed the law like, 10 years ago.
Yeah, well, I didn't vote for that.	Doesn't matter if you voted for it, it's the law.
I'll write that down so we don't forget.	Oh, darn it, no pencil.
It's a lovely name.	Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.
That's a joke.	That's a joke.
It funny because you are so clearly very classy.	Here, please, sit down.
Like I said, I got nothing here.	What if I could get some? - Mommy, Mommy.
I did, but we changed the time.	Grandma, this is Jesse.
He's from the meeting.	He's like a sponsor.
Jesse, this is Grandma.	Jesse, this is Brock.
Brock is almost 6.	You okay, with kids? What? Yeah.
He's gonna go play with his Legos and his cars.	Say, "Bye, Jesse".
My involvement in this is ongoing.	Understand? I can't just quit.
I have something of a contract.	But it's all very safe, professional.
It's a business you understand.	It's a story people will believe.
Not laser tag, this.	This is what we buy.
Yeah, I mean, there's free donuts.	Nothing's wrong with a free donut.
Hey, you know what? I have magical powers.	You wanna see? Ready? That's not real.
Do it again.	Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.
Come on, eat your food, Brock.	Can I have a chip? I'm gonna steal your chip.
All due respect, I don't see it.	So I vote no.
What? You know, that blue stuff you were talking about.	Maybe you had a line on some? - Wait.
What? Thought you said the kid is coming home.	Yeah, in a few hours.
It's not what I want.	Look, I was out of line talking about that stuff.
We both were.	You're right I don't know what you've been through.
You can tell me if you want.	This whole neighbourhood's run by gangs.
They run the drugs, control the streets.	They sort of took Tomas in.
No dad around.	Eight years old they got Tomas slinging.
I heard the rumours.	I didn't believe it at first.
But then I saw him like a week later.	And he told me, yeah, he did it.
They gave Tomas a	Gave him a choice.
Him or some dude.	So he did it.
Told me all about it like it was nothing.	Who did he say he kill? Some
From some outside crew.	Right around the corner from here, over off of Central.
Just because he was working the wrong corner.	It won't happen again.
I'm not leaving here till I'm well.	Hank, this isn't about insurance.
Hank, you get stronger every day.	You don't need to be in a hospital.
Wait till you see the bedroom.	I had them move the plasma in.
You get that out of my house.	You hear me, Marie? Today.
If we're looking for someone trustworthy.	What about me? What about you? Me.
No, no, Skyler, that is not a good idea.	I'm capable of managing a small business.
A legal business, not this.	Who else could we trust? - No.
Walt I'm in this.	And if I'm in it, I'm gonna do it right.
Married couples can't be compelled to testify against one another.	So there's that.
Yeah, I'll be there.	What was that? An invitation.
Walter, you're right on time.	Please, come in.
I hope you like paila marina.	It's a fancy name for fish stew.
I mean, this stew is simply an amalgam of ingredients.	Taken separately, these ingredients alone don't remind me of anything.
That's very interesting.	Walter I would like to help you, if I could.
And one must learn to be rich.	To be poor, anyone can manage.
You think you could hook me up? - Three hundred.	For a teenth? Shit, come on, yo.
You're a sweet girl.	Yes, you are.
Here you go.	Here you go.
30? - I'll be here with bells on.	What? It's just a saying.
Do you have a minute? - Yeah.	Could you keep an eye on your sister? - Sure.
"I never thought about it, officers.	Made sense to me".
Then again, he'd try anything.	I'm just not buying it.
Maybe if he were back sleeping in his own bed.	And suddenly a fantasy story.
Not every night, no.	Six nights a week.
One night off.	Dinner two nights.
I am going to be a part of this family.	That is how we'll sell your little fiction.
Yes, it's ours.	Now put it away.
Which means they work for our guy.	Right? What? No.
These two scumbags, they got him dealing.	They got him And you know he's not the first.
They use kids because hey, why not? Easy to control.	Easy to fool.
These guys kill	They used this little kid like some puppet.
How? - I need ricin.	Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.	Look, these two - Hey.
The delivery method, everything.	All I need from you is the poison, that's all.
No - Look.	Otherwise, you don't gotta lift a finger.
Well, I know I would be in prison after this.	Prison or worse.
And I'd be right alongside you.	No, Jesse, you cannot be serious.
That's what you said.	Untraceable back to us.
These guys don't.	Apples and oranges.
Now, murder is not part of your 12-step	This is not some amends that you have to make.
What you are talking about here is pointless.	This achieves nothing.
Jesse, listen to me.	You are not a
I'm not, and you're not.	It's as simple as that.
Chrissakes, Marie, you don't say "knock, knock," you like that.	I like saying it.
Well, that's not the rules.	Okay? - You knock your way, I'll knock mine.
But look, see? I win.	Not so fast.
Why? How is your old man? Back teaching? No.	I don't think either of them are working right now.
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.	Why not? What? That's what they said.
Why didn't you tell me? Let's wait then.	That's a joke.
The kid ain't coming.	Okay, so, what's plan B? - I don't know.
I really don't.	Well, let's brainstorm.
Or try, at least.	Okay, so we pay him off.
No, no, it's not about money.	It's about getting him off the streets.
Just some minor offence.	Pinkman in jail? I don't know.
I do all kinds of things for him.	Okay, so these guys are using kids like that.
Here we go.	Here we go.
Why? - Because it's moronic.	Saul said you've done things like this before.
No one knows I'm here.	Understand? But our employer would find out, like always.
I'd get called on domestic disputes all the time.	Hundreds, probably, over the years.
Wrists like little branches.	"Come on, tonight's the night we press charges.
This girl was scared.	She wasn't gonna cross him.
Swearing to God he's gonna leave her alone.	Screaming, much as you can with a gun in your
Just trying to do the right thing.	But two weeks later he kill
I'll never make that mistake again.	No more half measures, Walter.
Man, I don't get this.	I don't get this at all.
All I'm seeing is the kid.	So where are they? I don't know.
They're always around.	Burgers are getting cold.
So is it, like, fast? Don't sweat it.	You're just doing what you do.
Take a walk.	Where we going? Sit down.
It is possible they acted rashly.	But, on the other hand, there was provocation.
The man was selling on their territory.	There is blame on both sides.
This will go no further.	It will be settled right here, right now.
You told him? Wait outside.	Listen to me.
You don't look at him.	You look at me.
What are you doing? I'm just seeing.	Seeing what? - Seeing what I see.
Nothing's gonna happen.	I say it will.
You got one minute.	One minute? - Yeah.
It's just - It's pathetic.	That's good, keep talking.
Marie, give up.	I mean, seriously, it's not gonna happen.
Bad day? I don't even know.	Anyway it's better now.
Tell them you're busy.	Hello? Grandma? Slow down.
Hey, it's me.	Wait for the thing.
Jesse, you are now 42 minutes late.	I'm starting without you.
What is "wasabi"? - Wasabi.	Right you are.
What is "solo"? - This guy's good.	Four letter word, 2000.
"A loud, harsh cry; Walt Whitman's was barbaric.	" - "Yell.
" - What is "yawp"? - Kevin.	What is "yawp"? - Yawp.
I'll be right back.	That's what I said.
Okay to use your bathroom, right? Yeah, okay.	Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.	Hey, it's me.
Anyway, just call me back.	So the TV turns itself off, huh? - Yeah.
I'll get it.	The beginning of an early cold snap.
Nice to meet you.	Sandia Laboratories, huh? Yeah.
All right, that's a deal.	So this is it, honey.
He's actually a nice guy.	He doesn't push.
And this is the dining area.	Ah, the dining area.
Oh, and, uh-- It's got a pool.	Oh, pool is nice.
At least higher than here.	Walt, this is a good neighborhood.
I need my sleep.	You said no half measures.
You get your car fixed? Not yet.	You're gonna want to get your car fixed.
Where is Pinkman now? I wouldn't know.	A couple of time zones away, at least.
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.	He has enough money to last forever.
He knows he needs to keep moving.	You'll never find him.
I don't know, Walt.	It's what I do, after all.
He's out of the picture.	I saved his life.
They do to!	They do not!
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.	What good stuff?
What good stuff?	"The ""real you""."
"The ""real you""."	Like my fear of wearing pastels?

Good morning. How's it going?	Are you reasonably awake?
Are you reasonably awake?	Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?	Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Well, that's something.	Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.	I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.	But not completely inconceivable?
But not completely inconceivable?	I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.	I guess it isn't.
I guess it isn't.	Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
That seems very unlikely.	Yes, I thought so.
Sure, what is it?	Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.	Right. Just a sec.
The antenna has to be replaced.	Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?	Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.	I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.	Well, don't worry about it.
Well, don't worry about it.	And don't you worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.	Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Is your confidence in me fully restored?	Yes, it is, Hal.
Yes, I know.	You probably also know that we found them okay.

Luther was part of the gang?	What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?	I got a lot to protect.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.	I'll think about it.
You here to write my life story?	Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
You got a name, cop?	Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?	Sure, anything you want.

No wonder you're so popular.	No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.	So am I.

Great place for lunch.	Yeah, one of my favorites.

Call me later.	You sure you want me to?
You sure you want me to?	Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.	Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.	Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.	Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Hey, you know what I really think?	Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.

Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?	I can't find him.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.	But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.	I don't want to.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?	When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
I'm sure they're around.	Yeah, I'm not so sure.
You've been up all night?	That obvious, huh?
That obvious, huh?	Then you saw him, too?
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.	We have matching luggage.
You look great!	Save it for later.  Come on!
What the hell was that?	Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Here we are.	Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.	It's okay, we're just about there.
I've been working double shifts.	Extra money, huh?
Extra money, huh?	Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
It was Freddy.	Enough of that crap.
Been up with Alice.	How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Hey man, we're all sorry...	She knew she was gonna die.
I don't get it.	Let me talk to you.
What's wrong with me?	Your distraught.  It'll help...
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.	I though Freddy was just an old town story.
What is it?	Oh God!  He killed them!
I gotta get out of here.	You just stay put.  You need rest.
You just stay put.  You need rest.	You don't get it, he's after me...
You don't get it, he's after me...	Don't worry, honey
Feeling better now?	Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?	You had a nasty bump.
Excuse us, dear.	It's okay, Dan
Where is he?	He's inside you, where he hides.
Who says I don't like you?	My friend, with the funny hand.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.	How did you know that?
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?	It's lonely in there, in my room.
It's lonely in there, in my room.	My name is...
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?	Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.	He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?	Since my little girl became a mom...
Since my little girl became a mom...	You disappointed in me?
I'm so sorry, honey...	Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Thanks for everything, Dad.	You sure you don't want a ride to work?
You sure you don't want a ride to work?	It's just across the park.
Where are we going?	To take a picture.
You do good work, Alice.	So did Dan.
You think that's the place she's buried?	If they actually bothered to bury her.
Are you alright?	Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.	Had kind of a long night.
I don't understand.	She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
They think I'm nuts.	That's their problem.
I thought about that.	She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Mark, are you okay?	Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I've got to write some of this down.	That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.	Well we gotta do something!
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.	Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?	Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?	My undying love.  Have some.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.	I want to talk about the baby.
These things are wild...  What do you think?	Makes you look like a nun--
But if they <u>do</u>?	I don't know.
Unidentified Flying Objects.	Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
What is it?	Your 'out.'  This came for you.
Your 'out.'  This came for you.	My father!  He's not - ?
Dave - !	What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Somewhere down there?	Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?	We'll have to look for them later.
You hear that?	The sound again?
We're stuck tight!	Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?	What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?	Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
What course, Skipper?	Right at our one-eyed friend!
Course and speed?	Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
Is there any way out of it?	Seems to be all around...
Seems to be all around...	What about down?
Now they feel it...down below.	Radiation level...constantly rising...
As we near the Pole...	There's got to be an explanation!
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!	What direction does the system indicate?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!	Nothing we can do, now.
Right <u>at</u> him?	That's what I said!
That's what I said!	But - what can we accomplish?
But - what can we accomplish?	We can <u>ram</u> him!
You're sure it's Cyclops?	Take a look.
Determine extent of damage, immediately.	After torpedo room:  Report!
What do you think?	I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!	Toward the Pole!
Well, I'll be - !	I'll be another!
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?	What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Has anybody offered to buy it?	As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
Chub says you're fired.	He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
What are you boys up to?	Same old shit.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.	Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
He's on to us!	Shit! What are we gonna do?
You can't buy Wade off.	We bought you.
We bought you.	That was me.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?	No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
You heard the news.	I hear Twombley got shot.
Sun's gettin high.	Deers have ears too.
Drafted by the Red Sox.	You played for the Sox?
You played for the Sox?	Double A. New Britain.
You might not kill it.	You think so.
Open the door, will ya?	Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?	Open the door. We're late.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.	He sure as hell won't.
Where'd Twombley get shot?	In the chest.
In the chest.	No, I mean whereabouts.
No, I mean whereabouts.	A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.	You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.	The ambulance guys lugged him up.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.	You stayed away?
On your sleeve.	Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
Like you and Gordon?	Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.	Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
I thought I told you to move that truck!	Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
No brag. Just fact.	Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.	I want to go home.
I want to go home.	Okay, let's go home, then.
You're a policeman.	Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.	What are you sorry for?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?	Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --	I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Are we going in this?	Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.	It's pretty old.
It's pretty old.	It belongs to Pop.
I called Mommy.	What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.	I don't want to.
Yeah. It's stupid.	I guess they're stupid.
I guess they're stupid.	Did you do that when you were a kid?
Was it funny?	To us it was.
To us it was.	But it's not funny now.
I bet you did lots of bad things.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	I just think you used to be bad.
Those are the Hoyts.	I don't care. They're out.
Want to buy?	Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.	I won't. You interested?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?	On what you pay me?
How you holding up, Wade?	I'm fine, fine.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.	Something bugging you?
Something bugging you?	Yeah. A few things.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.	You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?	You mean Twombley?
What's the hurry?	A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.	Where's the plow?
Where's the plow?	Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.	His son-in-law damn near killed me.
You don't want the extra police pay?	I'm not saying that.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?	No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.	We should talk.
We should talk.	We've done all our talking, Wade.
Did you get his number?	I know who it is.
Think they're alright?	Of course! I would've heard.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.	You've been married twice --
I can see what you looked like as a kid.	You knew me as a kid.
You don't mean that.	Yeah. I mean that.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.	For a while.
For a while.	How's she doing?
How's she doing?	Okay. She's fine.
When did she die?	Is...? She's dead then?
There's a furnace.	You're not using it today?
You're not using it today?	It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
What the hell are you talking about?	I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.	Yes. Here's your ticket.
His office. You mean my old office.	Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.	He got his deer yet?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?	It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
You talked to Jack?	Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
The other guy.	Where... how'd you hear that?
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?	Love! I'm made of love!
Love! I'm made of love!	Call it what you want.
Call it what you want.	Everything you know is from me.
Pop, for Christ's sake!	You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Is there something wrong with the phone?	In the living room.
In the living room.	Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
You remember Margie Fogg?	From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?	It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.	You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
That it wasn't an accident.	Then who shot him?
Then who shot him?	Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.	Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?	I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.	Want to know what I think happened?
What about Margie?	What about her?
What about her?	Well, do you still plan to get married?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?	No thanks. I don't drink.
No thanks. I don't drink.	Yeah. I forgot.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.	Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I guess.	Get some sleep.
The night before the shooting.	How was she?
You think Jack shot him?	Well, it was an accident.
Daddy. Daddy, please...	Jim... for godsake!
Some kids were teasing you?	That's not really the point.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.	I'm sorry, honey.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.	You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...	Back at The Fishbowl?
You don't want to say hi to your father?	I'm sure he's busy.
I'm sure he's busy.	Don't you even want to ask?
Well, you aren't the President, dear.	Yeah, no duh.
He didn't leave us.	You are a resilient man, Mr.
I don't drink coffee.	You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.	No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
There they are!	Okay, I'm slowing us down.
How you doing, sweetie?	Been better, Dad... You?
How was...  ...the ballet?	It was the experience of a lifetime.
It was the experience of a lifetime.	How `bout a hug for the old man.
Oooooh, I'm good.	Hey, you guys back already?
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.	Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.	Lemme take a look.
Who's flying the fucking plane?	I'm doing what I can.
You read my mind.	Put your pilot on.
Put your pilot on.	He's busy being dead.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.	Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
They aren't answering their hails.	This doesn't make sense.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.	That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.	We don't know that.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.	An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.	Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?	To swear you in as President.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.	Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?	Yes, Mr. President.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.	why did they do that?
why did they do that?	Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.	Well it worked.
Who did this?	We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.	A secret service agent. It must be.
We've already been inspected.	Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
You're pointing a gun at me.	Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.	How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?	Scared. We're scared.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.	And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
A dubious distinction, no?	I guess it depends on your perspective.
Why? Do you enjoy it?	I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.	How can you? I mean they're people.
What do you know of my husband?	I know he left you behind.
I know he left you behind.	My husband is a very courageous man.
Now, or he dies, please.	Come on, Alice.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.	Hold on, Alice.
There goes your ride.	Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?	One thing I've learned as
You'll do it?	Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.	Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Sir, we stay with the President.	That isn't necessary.
What are you doing?	Flying the plane.
Flying the plane.	You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.	Both of you.
I don't know why you stayed.	Please... don't start with me.
I miss you. And I miss her.	But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.	I wish it were that easy...
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.	Rose, I don't have time for this.
May I speak to you for a moment?	Can't it wait?
Can't it wait?	No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Someone should give you a raise.	Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Where are we sending it?	White House Situation room.
The fax machines.	No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.	No. I thought about this, Mr.
What's going on?	We're under attack.
We're under attack.	Where's my family?
Where's my family?	We're handling it, sir.
Thank you for calling the white House...	No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
who can I say is calling?	This is the President.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.	They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.	Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
My god. I think that was a MiG.	A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?	I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
You give me ulcers.	That's my job.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.	We'll just say it was in bad taste.
Forget it.  I was reading.	I was reading too.
I was reading too.	What's the story?
What's the story?	Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...	I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.	That just doesn't make any sense.
Did you feel that?	Yes I did...
Yes I did...	Felt like a large asteroid.
Are you afraid?	Not when I'm with you, Ted.
That's right -- premature ejection.	What will happen to him, Ted?
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.	Not now, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine.	I mean until we start to burn up.
Elaine, what's going on?	Ted, there's no time to explain.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.	I've never used the word insane, Ted.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.	What word would you use, Elaine?
Ted, we're taking off!	Let me by, Elaine.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.	If that's the way you want it.
It's got to be stopped!	But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.	Is he making any progress, Doctor?
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.	I mean for Ted.
Can't we change course?	We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Have you got it straightened out now?	I think so.
I think so.	That's my girl.
Simon, why has he become so... so...	So mentally ill?
Frank's the best pilot in the program.	I'm so excited, Simon.
I'm so excited, Simon.	I guess this is a first for you.
I guess this is a first for you.	No, I've been excited before.
You can do it from up here, Captain.	I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.	No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.	I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.	Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...	Request; life support systems check.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.	That's okay, ROK.
That's okay, ROK.	Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.	All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.	Poached!  Not over!  Over!
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.	No.  Poached.  Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.	Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.	Just poached on toast.  Over.
What should I say?	Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?	Sixteen 'C', why?
Sixteen 'C', why?	He's carrying a bomb.
You folks need any help?	Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.	Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.	Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
You can't go in there!	Don't try to stop me!
Don't try to stop me!	But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
I have to see Bud Kruger.	Do you have an appointment, sir?
Do you have an appointment, sir?	No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.	You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.	All right, it's a matter of death.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?	That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.	Then Elaine was right.
Then Elaine was right.	Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!	Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.	Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
Do you want to talk about it.	I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.	No.  I mean your relationship.
Ah, won't you sit down?	Thank you. Cream?
Thank you. Cream?	No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.	Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?	Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Can you fly this airplane and land it?	Surely you can't be serious.
Can't you take a guess?	Well...not for another two hours.
Well...not for another two hours.	You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Captain, how soon can we land?	I can't tell.
Just how serious is it, doctor?	Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
What did he have?	He had fish.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?	Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.	Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
Rats! I've lost number three.	What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.	Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And a little ice.	And a little ice!
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!	That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
You got a telegram from headquarters today.	Headquarters!? What is it?
I love you, Elaine.	I love you.
Ted, what are you doing here?	Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.	You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.	Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.	Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.	You promise you'll write.
Did you decide on a runway yet?	Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
How ya doing, honey?	Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Oh, I can't stand it.	What is it?
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'	Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.	...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!	I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.	Oh, I'd love to.
Oh, I'd love to.	Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?	I will, but Jim won't.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.	All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?	No, why don't you take care ot it?
We have clearance, Clarence.	Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...	Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Do you feel all right, sir?	Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...	No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.	He didn't recognize me.
He didn't recognize me.	It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
How do I look?	You look very good.
We can't let him get away.	Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
But there's no more drug.	You understand that.  But how many others will?
What is this?!	... It's Harcourt.
... It's Harcourt.	Harcourt is dead.
No!  We must do this alone.	Do what?!  George-- ?!
What's this about, George?  I know that look.	There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.	If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
We?  You've taken it?	We all did.
Please, I must get out here.	Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.	Stop the car!
Well, let's roll, George.	To the... to the beach?
To the... to the beach?	Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Yeah... I know the routine.	You are married?
You are married?	Was.  Divorced.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.	When will Strader return?
Who is he?	Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.	Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Which one is that?  Raw what?	This is mole.  It's good.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .	Stay back!  I'm okay.
Back off, George.	But I-- .
But I-- .	I'll handle it.
Who said that?	At the end of the bar.
Why did you do it?	Why'd I do what?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.	Did you learn anything?
Get the picture?	And that fits?
And that fits?	Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.	And still it fits?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--	Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?	Sure.  Just a minute.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?	For you, anything.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?	You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
