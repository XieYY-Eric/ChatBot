You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?	I remember him.
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.	Look, I don't know what this...
What are you... ?	Take out your gun!
Where are the women?	They should be here any minute.
I'd rather you didn't.	What's the problem?
What's the problem?	I'm camera shy.
And they are?	I want to watch you work.
I want to watch you work.	I'll consider it.
You said something about money.	Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?	A fellow investor.
You're a dead man.	Leave him alone.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?	I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.	Why don't they come to me?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?	Call me Tom.
Easy enough for you.	I never killed anyone.
You got absolute zero.	Show me where you buried her.
Show me where you buried her.	I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.	Where?  Show me where.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.	Told him you could get him a snuff film.
How much did he pay you?	Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Starting to recognize a pattern?	What do you want?
What do you want?	Who is Machine?
Who is Machine?	I don't know...
I don't know...	I want his name.
I want his name.	I told you, I don't know.
I'm gonna kill you.	Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.	How'd you find me here?
Yeah, who's this?	I know what you did.
I know what you did.	Who is this.
Who is this.	You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...	What the fuck are you.. ?
Give me the film.	You'll get it when we get there.
They're no friends of mine.	Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Of what sort?	You are a private investigator?
Who is he?	I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...	Who is he, his name?
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.	It's their Presidential Suite.
Where are your parents?	I don't know, where are yours?
... Hello... ?	Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
How long you been working there?	Three, four years.
Three, four years.	What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
I'm not a cop.	You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
How much do you make now?	Four hundred a week, off the books.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.	"See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me ""pops."""
Big date tonight?	Yeah... guess so.
Yeah... guess so.	Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.	How are you?  Having any luck?
You told me to look, so I looked.	You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.	I'm not positive this means anything.
I'm not positive this means anything.	The checks were for odd amounts...
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...	You've found missing persons before.
You've found missing persons before.	Nothing remotely like this.
You... you need to go to the police.	I told you I can't, not yet.
I told you I can't, not yet.	You don't have any other choice.
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.	I'm afraid I don't...
Do you want to tell me what you found?	Cash, stock certificates, and this...
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.	I try to be.
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.	Who is this... ?
How... how can you say that to me...?	Will you let me look?
There wasn't one.  The police looked.	Do you think the police did a good job?
Do you think the police did a good job?	I don't know.  I think so.
We're all like that.	Are you religious?
What was she running from?	I don't know.
Why do you think he did it?	It got to be too much for him.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?	That's exactly what I am.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...	Neil... Neil Cole.
What is this?	Those are her belongings.
None too discreet, is he?	No, sir, he is not.
No, you may not.	Okay.  Fine.
Okay, I'll take it all.	Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
I can't go back to sleep again.	I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?	It was bad.
It was bad.	Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?	I can't find him.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.	But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.	I don't want to.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?	When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
I'm sure they're around.	Yeah, I'm not so sure.
You've been up all night?	That obvious, huh?
That obvious, huh?	Then you saw him, too?
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.	We have matching luggage.
You look great!	Save it for later.  Come on!
What the hell was that?	Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Here we are.	Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.	It's okay, we're just about there.
I've been working double shifts.	Extra money, huh?
Extra money, huh?	Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
It was Freddy.	Enough of that crap.
Been up with Alice.	How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Hey man, we're all sorry...	She knew she was gonna die.
I don't get it.	Let me talk to you.
What's wrong with me?	Your distraught.  It'll help...
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.	I though Freddy was just an old town story.
What is it?	Oh God!  He killed them!
I gotta get out of here.	You just stay put.  You need rest.
You just stay put.  You need rest.	You don't get it, he's after me...
You don't get it, he's after me...	Don't worry, honey
Feeling better now?	Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?	You had a nasty bump.
Excuse us, dear.	It's okay, Dan
Where is he?	He's inside you, where he hides.
Who says I don't like you?	My friend, with the funny hand.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.	How did you know that?
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?	It's lonely in there, in my room.
It's lonely in there, in my room.	My name is...
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?	Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.	He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?	Since my little girl became a mom...
Since my little girl became a mom...	You disappointed in me?
I'm so sorry, honey...	Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Thanks for everything, Dad.	You sure you don't want a ride to work?
You sure you don't want a ride to work?	It's just across the park.
Where are we going?	To take a picture.
You do good work, Alice.	So did Dan.
You think that's the place she's buried?	If they actually bothered to bury her.
Are you alright?	Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.	Had kind of a long night.
I don't understand.	She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
They think I'm nuts.	That's their problem.
I thought about that.	She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Mark, are you okay?	Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I've got to write some of this down.	That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.	Well we gotta do something!
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.	Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?	Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?	My undying love.  Have some.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.	I want to talk about the baby.
These things are wild...  What do you think?	Makes you look like a nun--
But if they <u>do</u>?	I don't know.
Unidentified Flying Objects.	Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
What is it?	Your 'out.'  This came for you.
Your 'out.'  This came for you.	My father!  He's not - ?
Dave - !	What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Somewhere down there?	Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?	We'll have to look for them later.
You hear that?	The sound again?
We're stuck tight!	Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?	What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?	Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
What course, Skipper?	Right at our one-eyed friend!
Course and speed?	Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
Is there any way out of it?	Seems to be all around...
Seems to be all around...	What about down?
Now they feel it...down below.	Radiation level...constantly rising...
As we near the Pole...	There's got to be an explanation!
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!	What direction does the system indicate?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!	Nothing we can do, now.
Right <u>at</u> him?	That's what I said!
That's what I said!	But - what can we accomplish?
But - what can we accomplish?	We can <u>ram</u> him!
You're sure it's Cyclops?	Take a look.
Determine extent of damage, immediately.	After torpedo room:  Report!
What do you think?	I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!	Toward the Pole!
Well, I'll be - !	I'll be another!
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?	What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Has anybody offered to buy it?	As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
Chub says you're fired.	He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
What are you boys up to?	Same old shit.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.	Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
He's on to us!	Shit! What are we gonna do?

Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?	Open the door. We're late.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.	He sure as hell won't.
Where'd Twombley get shot?	In the chest.
In the chest.	No, I mean whereabouts.
No, I mean whereabouts.	A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.	You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.	The ambulance guys lugged him up.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.	You stayed away?
On your sleeve.	Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?

No brag. Just fact.	Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.	I want to go home.
I want to go home.	Okay, let's go home, then.
You're a policeman.	Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.	What are you sorry for?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?	Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --	I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Are we going in this?	Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.	It's pretty old.
It's pretty old.	It belongs to Pop.
I called Mommy.	What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.	I don't want to.
Yeah. It's stupid.	I guess they're stupid.
I guess they're stupid.	Did you do that when you were a kid?
Was it funny?	To us it was.
To us it was.	But it's not funny now.
I bet you did lots of bad things.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	I just think you used to be bad.
Those are the Hoyts.	I don't care. They're out.
Want to buy?	Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.

It ain't done, if that's what you mean.	Something bugging you?
Something bugging you?	Yeah. A few things.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.	You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?	You mean Twombley?
What's the hurry?	A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.	Where's the plow?
Where's the plow?	Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.	His son-in-law damn near killed me.
You don't want the extra police pay?	I'm not saying that.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?	No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.	We should talk.
We should talk.	We've done all our talking, Wade.
Did you get his number?	I know who it is.
Think they're alright?	Of course! I would've heard.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.	You've been married twice --
I can see what you looked like as a kid.	You knew me as a kid.
You don't mean that.	Yeah. I mean that.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.	For a while.
For a while.	How's she doing?
How's she doing?	Okay. She's fine.
When did she die?	Is...? She's dead then?
There's a furnace.	You're not using it today?
You're not using it today?	It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
What the hell are you talking about?	I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.	Yes. Here's your ticket.
His office. You mean my old office.	Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.	He got his deer yet?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?	It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
You talked to Jack?	Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
The other guy.	Where... how'd you hear that?
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?	Love! I'm made of love!
Love! I'm made of love!	Call it what you want.
Call it what you want.	Everything you know is from me.
Pop, for Christ's sake!	You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Is there something wrong with the phone?	In the living room.
In the living room.	Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
You remember Margie Fogg?	From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?	It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.	You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
That it wasn't an accident.	Then who shot him?
Then who shot him?	Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.	Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?	I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.	Want to know what I think happened?
What about Margie?	What about her?
What about her?	Well, do you still plan to get married?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?	No thanks. I don't drink.
No thanks. I don't drink.	Yeah. I forgot.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.	Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I guess.	Get some sleep.
The night before the shooting.	How was she?
You think Jack shot him?	Well, it was an accident.
Daddy. Daddy, please...	Jim... for godsake!
Some kids were teasing you?	That's not really the point.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.	I'm sorry, honey.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.	You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...	Back at The Fishbowl?
You don't want to say hi to your father?	I'm sure he's busy.
I'm sure he's busy.	Don't you even want to ask?
Well, you aren't the President, dear.	Yeah, no duh.
He didn't leave us.	You are a resilient man, Mr.
I don't drink coffee.	You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.	No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
There they are!	Okay, I'm slowing us down.
How you doing, sweetie?	Been better, Dad... You?
How was...  ...the ballet?	It was the experience of a lifetime.
It was the experience of a lifetime.	How `bout a hug for the old man.
Oooooh, I'm good.	Hey, you guys back already?
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.	Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.	Lemme take a look.
Who's flying the fucking plane?	I'm doing what I can.
You read my mind.	Put your pilot on.
Put your pilot on.	He's busy being dead.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.	Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
They aren't answering their hails.	This doesn't make sense.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.	That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.	We don't know that.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.	An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.	Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?	To swear you in as President.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.	Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?	Yes, Mr. President.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.	why did they do that?
why did they do that?	Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.	Well it worked.
Who did this?	We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.	A secret service agent. It must be.
We've already been inspected.	Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
You're pointing a gun at me.	Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.	How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?	Scared. We're scared.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.	And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
A dubious distinction, no?	I guess it depends on your perspective.
Why? Do you enjoy it?	I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.	How can you? I mean they're people.
What do you know of my husband?	I know he left you behind.
I know he left you behind.	My husband is a very courageous man.
Now, or he dies, please.	Come on, Alice.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.	Hold on, Alice.
There goes your ride.	Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?	One thing I've learned as
You'll do it?	Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.	Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Sir, we stay with the President.	That isn't necessary.
What are you doing?	Flying the plane.
Flying the plane.	You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.	Both of you.
I don't know why you stayed.	Please... don't start with me.
I miss you. And I miss her.	But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.	I wish it were that easy...
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.	Rose, I don't have time for this.
May I speak to you for a moment?	Can't it wait?
Can't it wait?	No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Someone should give you a raise.	Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Where are we sending it?	White House Situation room.
The fax machines.	No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.	No. I thought about this, Mr.
What's going on?	We're under attack.
We're under attack.	Where's my family?
Where's my family?	We're handling it, sir.
Thank you for calling the white House...	No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
who can I say is calling?	This is the President.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.	They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.	Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
My god. I think that was a MiG.	A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?	I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
You give me ulcers.	That's my job.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.	We'll just say it was in bad taste.
Forget it.  I was reading.	I was reading too.
I was reading too.	What's the story?
What's the story?	Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...	I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.	That just doesn't make any sense.
Did you feel that?	Yes I did...
Yes I did...	Felt like a large asteroid.
Are you afraid?	Not when I'm with you, Ted.
That's right -- premature ejection.	What will happen to him, Ted?
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.	Not now, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine.	I mean until we start to burn up.
Elaine, what's going on?	Ted, there's no time to explain.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.	I've never used the word insane, Ted.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.	What word would you use, Elaine?
Ted, we're taking off!	Let me by, Elaine.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.	If that's the way you want it.
It's got to be stopped!	But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.	Is he making any progress, Doctor?
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.	I mean for Ted.
Can't we change course?	We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Have you got it straightened out now?	I think so.
I think so.	That's my girl.
Simon, why has he become so... so...	So mentally ill?
Frank's the best pilot in the program.	I'm so excited, Simon.
I'm so excited, Simon.	I guess this is a first for you.
I guess this is a first for you.	No, I've been excited before.
You can do it from up here, Captain.	I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.	No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.	I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.	Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...	Request; life support systems check.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.	That's okay, ROK.
That's okay, ROK.	Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.	All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.	Poached!  Not over!  Over!
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.	No.  Poached.  Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.	Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.	Just poached on toast.  Over.
What should I say?	Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?	Sixteen 'C', why?
Sixteen 'C', why?	He's carrying a bomb.
You folks need any help?	Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.	Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.	Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
You can't go in there!	Don't try to stop me!
Don't try to stop me!	But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
I have to see Bud Kruger.	Do you have an appointment, sir?
Do you have an appointment, sir?	No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.	You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.	All right, it's a matter of death.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?	That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.	Then Elaine was right.
Then Elaine was right.	Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!	Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.	Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
Do you want to talk about it.	I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.	No.  I mean your relationship.
Ah, won't you sit down?	Thank you. Cream?
Thank you. Cream?	No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.	Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?	Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Can you fly this airplane and land it?	Surely you can't be serious.
Can't you take a guess?	Well...not for another two hours.
Well...not for another two hours.	You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Captain, how soon can we land?	I can't tell.
Just how serious is it, doctor?	Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
What did he have?	He had fish.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?	Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.	Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
Rats! I've lost number three.	What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.	Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And a little ice.	And a little ice!
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!	That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
You got a telegram from headquarters today.	Headquarters!? What is it?
I love you, Elaine.	I love you.
Ted, what are you doing here?	Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.	You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.	Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.	Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.	You promise you'll write.
Did you decide on a runway yet?	Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
How ya doing, honey?	Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Oh, I can't stand it.	What is it?
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'	Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.	...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!	I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.	Oh, I'd love to.
Oh, I'd love to.	Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?	I will, but Jim won't.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.	All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?	No, why don't you take care ot it?
We have clearance, Clarence.	Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...	Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Do you feel all right, sir?	Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...	No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.	He didn't recognize me.
He didn't recognize me.	It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
How do I look?	You look very good.
We can't let him get away.	Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
But there's no more drug.	You understand that.  But how many others will?
What is this?!	... It's Harcourt.
... It's Harcourt.	Harcourt is dead.
No!  We must do this alone.	Do what?!  George-- ?!
What's this about, George?  I know that look.	There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.	If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
We?  You've taken it?	We all did.
Please, I must get out here.	Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.	Stop the car!
Well, let's roll, George.	To the... to the beach?
To the... to the beach?	Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Yeah... I know the routine.	You are married?
You are married?	Was.  Divorced.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.	When will Strader return?
Who is he?	Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.	Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Which one is that?  Raw what?	This is mole.  It's good.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .	Stay back!  I'm okay.
Back off, George.	But I-- .
But I-- .	I'll handle it.
Who said that?	At the end of the bar.
Why did you do it?	Why'd I do what?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.	Did you learn anything?
Get the picture?	And that fits?
And that fits?	Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.	And still it fits?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--	Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?	Sure.  Just a minute.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?	For you, anything.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?	You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Get outta there!	I can't!  Do you mind!
I can't!  Do you mind!	I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
You got your vest?	Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.	Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?	Whatever gave you that idea?
Can't lock up...	Talk to me, Hudson.
Talk to me, Hudson.	Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.	Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.	Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Okay, let's do it.	Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
You did okay, Bishop.	Well, thanks, I --
HOW MUCH TIME?	PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!	WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.	See you soon.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.	How long until it blows?
You son of a bitch.	Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.	What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.	I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
No.  There's no way!	Hear me out...
Have they located my daughter yet?	Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Still nothing from the colony?	Dead on all channels.
I told them to fall back...	They're but off!  Do something!
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!	Shut up.  Just shut up!
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.	So?  So?
What is it?	I don't know.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...	Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
One of us?	Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.	The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.	Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
...We're coming in.	He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
Are there any questions?  Hudson?	How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.	What's the question?
Well you're not reading it right!	Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
We got problems.	I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Let's get the fuck out of here!	Not that tunnel, the other one!
Hicks, don't let him leave.	We ain't going anywhere.
They'll get us.	Maybe.  Maybe not.
They're in the approach corridor.	On my way.
It's inside the complex.	You're just reading me.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?	No.  Have you?
Nine meters.  Eight.	Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Can't be.  That's inside the room!	It's readin' right.  Look!
Range twenty meters.	Seal the door.
Looks like it stung him.	Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.	How long have I been on Gateway station?
Can we dream?	Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.	I know, honey.  Me too.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.	Wah...?  Where are...?
Wah...?  Where are...?	Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
No, it's different, honey.	Did you ever have a baby?
Did you ever have a baby?	Yes.  A little girl.
Yes.  A little girl.	Where is she?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.	Did one of those things grow inside her?
Yes, there are, aren't there.	Why do they tell little kids that?
I guess we're not leaving, right?	I'm sorry, Newt.
Cross my heart.	And hope to die?
Casey.  She's my only friend.	What about me?
How many colonists?	Sixty, maybe seventy families.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.	His Grace is very angry with you.
His Grace is very angry with you.	What do you mean?
How was I? Tell me honestly.	You were sublime.
You were sublime.	What did you think of the music?
What does he look like?	You might be disappointed.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.	Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Oh - excuse me!	Is her mother still lying on the floor?
Is her mother still lying on the floor?	No, she's fine.
No, she's fine.	I'm so relieved.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?	I've come to dinnnnnner!
What is it?	I want to go!
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.	What are you talking about?
Give me one reason I can understand.	I can't write it!
You're not going to do this?	Why not? Half the house!
Yes, my love?	These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
There's a young girl to see you.	What does she want?
What does she want?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Well, ask her!
What's the matter with you?	Tell them to go!
Tell them to go!	Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!	Oh, leave me alone.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.	This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Oh, ha, ha, ha.	Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!	Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Yes, you are. You're very sick.	No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Em iram! Em iram!	No, I'm not playing this game.
No, I'm not playing this game.	No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Why? People fart backwards.	Do you think that's funny?
This is not his handwriting.	No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
I was at hand.	Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.	He needs me, ma'am.
He asked me to stay.	And I'm asking you -
Some service deserves service in return. No?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Isn't it obvious?
It is miraculous.	Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
These are originals?	Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Then he didn't send you?	No, sir. This is my own idea.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?	He's terribly busy, sir.
Leave him alone!	I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?	He's doing his best.
He's doing his best.	I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Am I interrupting something?	Not at all.
Not at all.	Where's our friend?
When, may I ask?	In three months! Papa.
What a strange young man.	Yes. He is a little strange.
Just one year.	Who was your teacher?
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.	Of course not.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.	And the result satisfies.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!	I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.	Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
What a charming idea. May I see?	It's just a trifle, of course.
It's just a trifle, of course.	May I try it?
Well, yes, I admit it is.	Would you tell me why?
Would you tell me why?	Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.	Thank you, Sire!
What? On one hearing only?	I think so, Sire, yes.
Oh, thank you.	The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.	Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Well, what do you have for me today?	Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -	Yes, what about him?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.	No one calls you that.
No one calls you that.	She does. She says I sleep all day.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.	But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.	Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?	Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
It's a secret.	You don't have secrets from me.
How is your financial situation?	It couldn't be better.
It couldn't be better.	That's not what I hear.
They say you're in debt.	Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!	How many pupils do you have?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.	This one will.
Is she not here?	I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Why are you here?	Am I not welcome?
Am I not welcome?	Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?	I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!	Why? What has happened?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.	Is he working?
Where does he work?	In there, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.	Do any pupils come to the house?
Do any pupils come to the house?	Not that I've seen.
Really? What is it he's writing?	Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?	Yes, thank you, sir.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.	Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.	What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Well, we can.	So let me see it. Where is it?
Put it down!	What is this?
What is this?	Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?	Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.	I liked the horse.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!	That kind of music should be punishable by death.
I'm sorry. No.	Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.	My answer is no, Mozart.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.	Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.	Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
I'm afraid I am.	Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Do you want to rest a bit?	Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?	Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?	I'm not leaving you.
I'm not leaving you.	I am so ashamed.
And that's it. Do you have it?	You go fast!
You go fast!	Do you have it?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?	Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Do you have me?	I think so.
It couldn't be simpler.	First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?	With the tenors.
I think so.	Sing it back.
Where did I stop?	The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Consigned to flames of woe.	Do you believe in it?
Would you? Actually, you could.	My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
Shall I answer it?	No! No, it's him!
Are you ill?	The doctor thinks I am. But -
You mean she's not coming back?	You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
What happened? Is it over?	I'm taking you home. You're not well.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.	No, no. I have to get back. I have -
A Mass for the dead.	What dead? Who is dead?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.	How could I not?
How could I not?	Did my work please you?
Did my work please you?	How could it not, Excellency?
I never knew that music like that was possible.	You flatter me.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.	Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!	Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
You burned the score?	Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
Oh, Excellency, would you?	With all my heart, Mozart.
With all my heart, Mozart.	Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Of course not.	Do you have a daughter?
Do you have a daughter?	I'm afraid not.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.	I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.	Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
What exactly are you working on?	I can't say. Really
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.	Did you like it, then?
Did you like it, then?	How could I not?
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.	But this is absurd!
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?	Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
What are you doing, Herr Director?	Taking out what you should never have put in.
That will do, Herr Mozart!	Just let me tell you how it begins.
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?	What is what?
Because His Majesty wishes it.	Is the Emperor angry with me?
Is the Emperor angry with me?	On the contrary.
On the contrary.	Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?	Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.	No, but I'm the best.
No, but I'm the best.	A little modesty would suit you better.
A little modesty would suit you better.	Who is on this committee?
Who is on this committee?	Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.	Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
I don't think it was really decided, Director.	Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
No, you didn't!	I poisoned his life.
I poisoned his life.	But not his body.
But not his body.	What difference does that make?
You cannot say that!	No? Was Mozart a good man?
Did you try?	Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
Do you hear me?	He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.	Ah - you've heard that?
Ah - you've heard that?	All Vienna has heard that.
All Vienna has heard that.	And do they believe it?
And do they believe it?	Is it true?
Is it true?	Do you believe it?
In the sight of God that is a sin.	What do you want?
What do you want?	Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.	Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.	I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.	I do not seek forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?	I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Here in Vienna.	Then you must know this.
About the ballet.	Ballet? What ballet?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?	Yes, in the third act.
Are you absolutely sure?	I've seen the manuscript.
Bravo, Your Majesty!	Well done, Sire!
I can't wait.	Well, promise then.
Well, promise then.	What do you mean - now?
What do you mean - now?	Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Here I am, my angel.	What? Who the devil are you?
That lady is back, sir.	Show her in. Then go to bed.
Who is she?	She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.	Excuse me, my dear.
Yes, I am looking after him.	Can we come in?
Can we come in?	Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.	But he's all right?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?	The American? Yes, duck.
The American? Yes, duck.	How did he look?
How did he look?	What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
What shall we do?	Tea would be nice.
Could you get here without any trouble?	Yes, I should think so.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?	He's fine. We'll come right over.
He's fine. We'll come right over.	Shall I send a car?
Shall I send a car?	No, a cab will be faster.
No, a cab will be faster.	I expect you shortly.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.	The zoo? Is he rational?
Is David acting strangely?	No, not really.
What did he say?	David says Jack comes to warn him.
It's a full moon. Where is he?	At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.	Come to my office, Miss Price.
Did he say a wolf?	Yes, I believe he did.
What exactly did he call out?	He said 'Jack'.
He said 'Jack'.	That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.	What happened to them?
David, don't lose control.	Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
Hopeless. It's hopeless.	David, let's go now.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...	Will you shut up!?!!
We had an argument. He's being silly.	I swear, I don't know this girl.
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.	Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
David, what are you doing?	Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
The next corner we can get a cab.	I should be committed.
I should be committed.	Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.	See you later.
I've left those pills for you.	A doper werewolf.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.	Do me an enormous favor?
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.	It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.	Werewolves simply do not exist.
Werewolves simply do not exist.	David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?	Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Tomorrow is the full moon.	That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
It's nice to see you.	It's nice to see you.
My friend Jack was just here.	Your dead friend Jack?
I was dreaming again?	I would think so.
I would think so.	Yeah, I would think so, too.
Are you better now?	I'll let you know the next full moon.
I'll let you know the next full moon.	You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Hello. You all right?	I'm sorry I woke you up.
I'm sorry I woke you up.	Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?	No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.	That's easy enough.
Not just a patient -- me.	You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?	Now I'm embarrassed.
How old are you?	That's not really a very proper question.
That's not really a very proper question.	How old are you?
Now what do you want to talk about?	Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?	My best friend. My very best friend.
My best friend. My very best friend.	Shall I read to you?
Shall I read to you?	What? Oh, yes, please.
What do you dream about?	I dream of death mostly.
I dream of death mostly.	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.	It's okay. I want to talk to you.
You're a very beautiful girl.	I thought you were asleep.
I thought you were asleep.	I was. What are you reading?
I was. What are you reading?	'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.	Do you like it?
Do you like it?	I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?	Will you give me a break?
Call me David.	Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Aw come on, Miss Price!	Call me Alex.
Call me Alex.	Aw come on, Alex!
Aw come on, Alex!	Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
You haven't eaten your lunch.	I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.	I'm afraid you have to eat something.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.	Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.	You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.	How is that?
It wasn't a lunatic.	I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?	It was a wolf.
He all right?	Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Chart says he's from New York.	I think he's a Jew.
I think he's a Jew.	Why on earth do you say that?
All right, you two, move along.	Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!	There's no call for that kind of language.
Officer, I killed those people last night.	You did, did you?
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!	You could have told them!
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.	Oh, come on, tell us.
Oh, come on, tell us.	No. You've had your chance.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.	Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.	What are you going to see?
Do you have bad dreams, too?	Some, everyone does.
Some, everyone does.	Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.	I was having a nightmare.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.	Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.	Did you see Jack?
There were witnesses?	So they said.
Where am I?	You're in a hospital in London.
You're in a hospital in London.	London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.	I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Because this must be stopped.	How shall I do it?
What can I say, Jack?	You don't have to say anything.
You don't have to say anything.	Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?	If I was still alive, I probably would.
If I was still alive, I probably would.	You look awful.
What are you doing here?	I wanted to see you.
I wanted to see you.	Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Jack, are you really dead?	What do you think?
You're not real.	Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
We were attacked by a werewolf.	I'm not listening!
Debbie Klein cried a lot.	I can't stand it.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?	Life mocks me even in death.
Nice to see you.	Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.	Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot.	This is too much. I can't handle this.
You really scared me, you shithead.	Are you going to help me up?
Where are we going?	I'll tell you when we get there.
I'll tell you when we get there.	Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
It sounds far away.	Not far enough. Come on.
Nice doggie. Good boy.	Walk away, Jack.
Walk away, Jack.	Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
It's in front of us.	Do you think it's a dog?
Shit! David, what is that?	I don't know. Come on.
I don't know. Come on.	Come on, where?
Come on, where?	Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
There aren't any coyotes in England.	The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.	No, but he was on the moors.
No, but he was on the moors.	It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Did you hear that?	I heard that.
I heard that.	What was it?
What do you think was wrong?	I have no idea.
I have no idea.	Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Beware the moon?	Come on, I'm freezing.
Jack, we'd better go.	What do you mean? I'm starving.
Go on, ask them.	You ask them.
Ask them what the candles are for.	You ask them.
What about it?	It's a five-pointed star.
It's a five-pointed star.	Maybe the owners are from Texas.
Nice looking group.	Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.	Look at that.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.	A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
She's a jerk.	You're talking about the woman I love.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?	I don't know.
Well, I like it here.	I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
No, thank you, Doctor.	Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Excuse me.  Yes?	Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Hello, there. What can I get you?	Campari and soda would do nicely.
Remember the Alamo?	I beg your pardon?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...	And what, Sergeant?
And what, Sergeant?	I don't rightly know, sir.
No, thank you.	I'd like some tea, please.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?	Yes - sure
Yes - sure	Yeah - sure!
Let me have ten bucks?	Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
About twenty-four thousand.	It was more than that last week.
Mr. Dickson in yet?	Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.	The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.	All right, Jack, all right.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?	That's very simple. I was home.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !	You don't have to do nothing.
I'm sorry, Dude, butI	That don't do us any good.
That don't do us any good.	But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.	I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]	A misunderstood bachelor.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?	Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Why are you so anxious?	Don't you know?
Doesn't that come next?	Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?	See, we're getting along famously!
Well, you can. You always could.	Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .	Why, I needed a
Shall we let the people come in?	Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?	I'm feeling fine this morning.
I'm feeling fine this morning.	That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.	John, how's your wife this morning?
John, how's your wife this morning?	Much better this morning, thank you.
Much better this morning, thank you.	Got a handkerchief?
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?	Yes, of course.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?	Numbers? No, never mind.
Where is he now?	In Mr. Sampson's office.
In Mr. Sampson's office.	Now don't you worry about it.
Why - well, I	Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Mr. Sampson . . .	All right. Send him in.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.	Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.	Got my letter?
Got my letter?	Yes, thank you.
Looks good. How much did it cost?	I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?	I haven't any.
I haven't any.	You haven't got a uniform?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?	You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?	Were you in Cluett's apartment?
No. I won't.	You're protecting somebody.
You're protecting somebody.	No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
I already told him I was home.	There you are.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.	Sure, I think it's swell.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?	No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.	Why pick on him ?
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.	Did you get the case for the securities?
The lobby's half filled now.	What are you talking about?
Well, Sampson, what is it?	Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.	Is it safe?
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.	Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?	He's at a board meeting.
He's at a board meeting.	Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.	I'm afraid so.
I'm afraid so.	Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?	Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.	They must have turned him down.
They must have turned him down.	Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Oh, Matt . . .	Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
What's keeping you?	Oh, Charlie again.
Oh now, don't be silly.	Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.	I tell you, I saw them!
Well . . . ?	Well, he was making love to her.
The ten dollars.	Oh, ten dollars
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!	Oh, is that so?
He was in the bank yesterday.	He was here?
He was here?	He came to see Mr. Cluett.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.	Are you sure?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...	It couldn't have been earlier?
It couldn't have been earlier?	No. It wasn't earlier because...
No. It wasn't earlier because...	Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
for the rheumatism, you know.	What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
What time did you get in?	Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.	Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Then who changed it?	I don't know.
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!	You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?	Bought himself a pocketbook!
How are you fixed?	I'm okay, Matt.
I'm okay, Matt.	You've got enough?
This is healing?	Sometimes a wound will kill.
Sometimes a wound will kill.	Now you tell us.
I couldn't lose him.	Jim Younger, I told you--
I think I may just go on to the reservation.	Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
You can ride like that?	I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
He's not bad at it.	It's tougher than it looks.
I'm sorry, Cole.	You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
I swear --	Swear on Jimmy's grave.
How'd they --	What have you done?
What have you done?	I ain't done --
I ain't done --	WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
We got a problem here, brother?	Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
Uhh, yeah it does.	You stay out of this, Bob.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.	That was two hours ago.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.	Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!	Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...	... Will Perry ...
You are a fine figure of a man.	Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.	He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's been full of vinegar lately.	He's planning a job.
You have no shame.	Not yet. But I'm hoping.
What you sayin' boy?	I think I recognize you.
Missed you, cousin.	Missed you too, cousin.
Bob, rip up some bandages.	Pass me some whisky.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.	Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Still smells fishy.	Then let me run the show, General Lee.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.	And I'm the better outlaw.
A bad idea.	I got us through the War all right.
I got us through the War all right.	And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.	If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.	What are you saying?
It'll be the biggest score yet.	What will be?
I got seven thousand.	I got three.
She had a moustache.	She was European!
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?	She got two of them.
Hands off your hip, Cole.	You're not scared, are you?
You're not scared, are you?	Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.	Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Where you boys going?	There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Ride with me, cousin?	I could use the walk.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.	What's going on?
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.	You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Another dozen out back.	They gonna rush us?
They gonna rush us?	They're just insurance in case we run.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...	Sadie was not a man!
I think one of 'em's glass.	Which one, right or left?
Which one, right or left?	The brown one.
Cannon or Gatling?	Both would be nice.

I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!	You're right, sir.
You're right, sir.	Then why can't I go in there?
Then why can't I go in there?	On account of we're robbing it.
On account of we're robbing it.	Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?	It's a secret.
It's a secret.	Fine. I'll just wait here.
Fine. I'll just wait here.	I'd appreciate that.
Where the hell were you?	I had you covered.  From back there.
What the --	What is it?
What is it?	Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
What do you say, sir?	Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
Web died fighting?	Died a hero.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.	My little Web did that?
They're gone. What are you --	I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.	You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.	Got any ideas, little brother?
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?	No, I --
This has been a good year.	Jesse, we're outlaws.
Jesse, we're outlaws.	And we're good at it.
You've killed your fair share of men.	If I could go back to farming --
We're doing this for Ma.	Maybe it started out that way. But now...
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.	And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
How'd it go in there?	Fine. How'd it go out here?
Fine. How'd it go out here?	We're gonna have to talk...
You know him?	Heard of him.
She's still talking to Jesus.	What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
"""Big and older""?"	You can shut up now.
You can shut up now.	You are a charmer.
You are a charmer.	I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.	"Next time try ""fat and haggard."""
Frank, don't you have something to say?	You're doing just fine.
You're doing just fine.	Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Distracting enough for you?	Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
How much of that story is true?	Everything but the boring parts.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.	That he was.
That he was.	They're making him a hero now.
They're making him a hero now.	Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.	But he killed a lot of men, too.
But he killed a lot of men, too.	Can't argue that.
Can't argue that.	So what was he?
Did you kill Yankees?	A fair number, Ma.
A fair number, Ma.	Say your prayers?
Aw, shucks, ma'am...	Stop it. This is just sad.
Stop it. This is just sad.	Swimming. Swimming is good.
Let the law --	Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.	Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
I am so sorry, Jesse.	Frank and me have to go away for a while.
A river pirate.	Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Not if I find the right girl.	And what's this right girl like?
Where will you find such a girl?	Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
You're sick of my company?	No! I mean, of course not. No.
No! I mean, of course not. No.	Teasing you is completely unfair.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?	You were little Jesse James when you left.
You were little Jesse James when you left.	But you got big!
That's what I would have done.	I'm not hanged yet.
I'm not hanged yet.	You cocky little bastard.
You cocky little bastard.	Ahh, you'll miss me.
We're moving you tomorrow.	But I like the presidential suite.
Now let's have a drink.	Right here in church?

Well, not exactly.	You been with a girl ever?
I hope I'm not being too forward.	Not at all.
Not at all.	I just though you were awful cute.
I just though you were awful cute.	Thank you, Miss -- ?
There's only four of them...	Move you fools!
They had to be dealt with!	By burning down their homes?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.	I'm doing you folks a favor --
How did you know?	Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
This is him.	I remember you.
The final route for the railroad is complete.	I look forward to seeing it.
With my money!	We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
Your men knew the risks.	What is going on here, man?
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!	To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.	THEN WHO DID?!
What is that?	Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
Can't you tell me anything?	It's going to be a long spring.
So you can't tell me anything?	It's going to be a long winter.
This is no game.	I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
What are you doing tonight?	Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

I know. Stop it.	Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
This is nicer than your other apartment.	It's not that nice.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.	I don't think so.
I haven't seen you around here.	You just haven't been looking.
You just haven't been looking.	Would you like to see my apartment?
Where are you going?	I'm just leaving.
Oh God, I can't believe this.	I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
No, no, no.	I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
You're really serious, aren't you?	Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.	But what about the past? Our past?
But what about the past? Our past?	We never really shared one.
We need to talk.	Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?

I want a firm commitment.	I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Are you using minoxidil?	No. I'm not. Why should I ?

Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.	Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Don't come back.	I won't...don't worry.
I think you should go now.	But I think...I want to know what happened here.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.	Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Doesn't he live here?	No, he doesn't.
No, he doesn't.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	You saw the ad in the Times?
Can I help you?	I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?	It's just not.
It's just not.	Why not, you stupid bastard?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?	What exactly do you mean?
What exactly do you mean?	The message you left.
Where are you going?	I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Call me please, Patrick.	Jesus lives, Luis.
Patrick? Is that you?	No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Lucky, I guess.	That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
It looks so soft.	Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Don't, I'll drink it.	Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.	Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?	I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!	Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.	Ask me a question.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...	Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.	But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
What's that, a gram?	New card. What do you think?
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?	Maybe it's just the light.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?	It looks that way, doesn't it?
We are totally booked.	Oh really? That's great.
Oh really? That's great.	I said we are totally booked.
I said we are totally booked.	Two at nine? Perfect.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?	Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

Patrick? Is that you?	Hello? Jean, I need help!
Hello? Jean, I need help!	Where are you?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?	Patrick? I can't hear you.
Patrick? I can't hear you.	What are I doing?
What are I doing?	Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?	I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Do you have a boyfriend?	No, not really.
Want a bite?	I'm on a diet. But thank you.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.	You didn't give them a name.
You didn't give them a name.	They know me.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...	Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.	No, come on. Anywhere you want.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.	Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
That is...if you're not doing anything.	Oh no. I have no plans.
Oh no. I have no plans.	Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Tell him I'm at lunch.	Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
You don't like this, I take it?	Come on, you're prettier than that.
Oh, something. . romantic?	No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.	I'll do it.
That's...that's too bad.	You think I'm dumb, don't you?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.	No. I really don't.
No. I really don't.	That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
So, what do you do?	What do you think I do?
What do you think I do?	A model? An actor?
A model? An actor?	No. Flattering, but no.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.	Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.	Does he do this all the time?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.	He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.	Don't tell him you're here.
Don't tell him you're here.	Why would I?
He does? You're sure?	I checked it out. It's clean.
I checked it out. It's clean.	Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?	Where was Marcus?
Where was Marcus?	He wasn't with Paul Owen.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.	So who was he with?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?	I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.	But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
No hash browns?	Not in the mood, I guess.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.	Not a big music fan, eh?
Not a big music fan, eh?	No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.	Wait. That's not what I've got.
That's not the information I've received.	Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?	Let's see...  That you were with-
Let's see...  That you were with-	Well, I could he wrong.
Well, I could he wrong.	Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
"How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for ""formal questioning?"""	0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?	Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
So...you hang out here a lot?	Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...	Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.	Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.	Oh really? I didn't know that.
The earth just opens up and swallows people.	Eerie. Really eerie.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?	We were both seven in 1969.
We were both seven in 1969.	So was I.
So was I.	Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Well, maybe he did, huh?	His girlfriend doesn't think so.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.	But...has anyone seen him in London?
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.	Do you feel that way?
Do you feel that way?	No. Not really.
No. Not really.	Where did Paul hang out?
He had a yacht?	No, he just hung out there.
No, he just hung out there.	And where did he go to school?
Would you rather I not smoke?	No, I guess it's okay.
Pardon me, but are you okay?	Who do you ask?
How old are you?	Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.	Where did you go to school?
Where did you go to school?	Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

Understandable.  Lime?	No, really. I'm okay.
No, really. I'm okay.	You sure? I can always get you a lime.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-	Oh no, I'm okay.
Oh no, I'm okay.	It's no problem
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?	Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.	Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
No. I'm okay.	Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Perrier? San Pellegrino?	No, I'm okay.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL	Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

Gee, uh, that's too bad.	I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.	It's cold out, too, isn't it?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?	I'm so hungry.
Is that a raincoat?	Yes, it is.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?	Cecelia is, well...you know
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?	Oh well, you know.
Oh well, you know.	And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.	Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?	I've been great. And you?
You think so?	You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.	Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
You don't wanna move, do you?	I can paint anywhere.
You are a fanatic.	'Gonna wait outside.
...wanna savor this.	It's gonna get cold.
It's gonna get cold.	Right. Wait. A toast.
Right. Wait. A toast.	You're just afraid to eat it.
Don't we have any chopsticks?	Oh, right. Hold on.
You look beautiful.	Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.	Poor baby. You know that's not true.
...Whaddo I do?	So you believe me?
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.	Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.	"""Like this?"" It's Gary you're talking about."
"""Like this?"" It's Gary you're talking about."	You think I don't know that?
You think I don't know that?	Milo. Why would he --
I can't just walk away!	You can't just walk in, either.
Teddy was killed last night.	What're you -- what?
What're you -- what?	It was a hate crime.
He's your boss. He's not your --	I know, I know.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?	Milo! What about --?
That took some fun out of --	We're not gonna let it.
Didn't you visit the campus?	I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.	No way. You have this -- destiny.
He wasn't acting?	I don't think he knows how.
He'll tell me when he gets home.	That'll be a test, won't it?
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.	And Outpost? You're happy there?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.	Have a seat.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?	...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?	Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Is it your software?	Is it your dish?
You're interfaced with our dish.	Gimme the coordinates?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?	'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?	He's pretty tight with his family.
He's pretty tight with his family.	We could move 'em up here.
Gary, I --	You see what's hanging on the wall?
You could've handwritten it.	I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.	"Oh, that's right. You're ""clueless."""
That's great! Thanks.	'Sorry about the late notice...
You look a little tired.	I'm okay. It's going well!
I'm okay. It's going well!	'Have a look?
The wrong place?	The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
Talk about work? Never!	I meant did you find other stuff to --
I heard what happened.	Were the flags for Teddy?
You really wrote this just today?	What're you implying.
Milo. What's up?	Well -- you sent for me.
You did this -- overnight?	You're making me young again.
It's okay. Really.	Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
How's it going?	Maybe I'm going too fast.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.	That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.	That's what I told her. My wife.
You know a lot about art, I guess.	There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Would you like a Coke or something?	Oh. No thanks.
Longitude 109 --	Wait... He knows.
Gary, don't worry, we --	Just do what I'm asking!
Hasn't affected his work, though.	Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
What'd the girl say?	There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
This is good. Who did it?	'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.	Maybe we should all get on it.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.	We'll come up with the next big thing.
We'll come up with the next big thing.	...You wanna work -- here?
...You wanna work -- here?	Got out of my other commitment.
Come with me.	Where we going?
You calling Phil and Randy?	I'm calling Gary.
What're we looking for?	Any irregularity in the pattern.
Latitude 47 degrees.	Wait a second. He knows I know.
Maybe it's the satellite.	Let's try #2.
It's three years old, it --	Bring it to the other location.
Bring it to the other location.	But you said the other --
Meet me at the other location.	Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.	That's lame, isn't it?
That's lame, isn't it?	You'll come up with something.
I told Teddy about you.	What'd he say?
What'd he say?	"""A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"""
Why were you snooping in my office?	Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
You mean -- break in?	I don't know --
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.	They'd frame him.
They'd frame him.	He's out of prison?
I snuck into #21.	Why would you do a thing like --
That's great. I -- didn't know.	She saved my life.
What've you got there?	Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
You know my name.	You know mine.
You know mine.	You're famous around here.
You're famous around here.	I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.	Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?	...Something like that. Yeah.
I met this girl.	What? Come on. Is it serious?
What? Come on. Is it serious?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Did you tell Alice?
What does that mean?	Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.	I didn't plan this.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...	Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
Is that how Larry feels?	Uh. Not exactly.
So how'd you like the house?	His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
So -- how far are we from the campus?	Oh we're not going to the campus.
Maybe he'll get back to work.	Speaking of which...
Who're these guys?	Where is he?
Where is he?	We're too late. Take a look.
That kid's the great white hope.	I could get it out of him.
I could get it out of him.	You're not listening.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?	Is it about my teeth?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.	To my health.
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?	Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.	Or sometimes not at all.
Or sometimes not at all.	Care for some saki?
Care for some saki?	Sak-i it to me!
You seem surprised to see me.	I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.	Hey, how are you?
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!	Austin, I have something for you as well.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.	Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.	Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
My God, Austin, what have you done?	That's not your mother, that's a man!
She's working on another lead right now.	Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.	Thank you, Basil.
Thank you, Basil.	Oh, and Austin...
Oh, yes. Thank you.	There's one more thing, Austin.
Right away, Exposition.	Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Thank you, Exposition.	Oh, and Austin...
Thank you, Exposition.	Oh, and Austin...
When do I begin?	Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.	You mean Mrs. Kensington?
We won, Austin.	Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?	Well, you can't always get what you want.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.	Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?	That does not compute.
That does not compute.	Why not? It's a question.
Why not? It's a question.	Love is... love is... love is...
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.	Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.	Man, you are one chilly square!
I have something to tell you.	Lay it on me.
Lay it on me.	I love you, Austin.
I love you, Austin.	That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.	Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Does that make you horny?	Not now, Austin.
Austin, may I have a word with you?	Of course, luv.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.	No, did you use a condom?
No, did you use a condom?	Only sailors use condoms, man.
Only sailors use condoms, man.	Not in the Nineties.
You're smashed, Vanessa.	I am not.
I am not.	Oh, yes you are.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.	No, this is me in a nutshell.
Fancy a nibble?	I couldn't have another bite.
I hate having my picture taken.	You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
Let's go get him!	He's too well-protected right now.
He's too well-protected right now.	We can't just sit here, Austin.
I don't get it.	Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.	How do you know?
How do you know?	I never forget a pussy... cat.
A limousine has just pulled up.	Let me see.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?	Do you want to talk to him?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.	We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Danger Powers, personal effects.	Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.	It says here, name Danger Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.	Danger's my middle name.
Don't mind if I do.	Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Here, have a piece of gum.	Here, have a piece of gum.
Everything seems to be in order.	Hey, wait a minute--
Commander, I have to log it...	That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?	What's its current position?
Ow! You shot me!	Right. Okay. Moving on.
Right. Okay. Moving on.	You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
They're mutated sea bass.	Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?	Please allow me to demonstrate.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.	The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.	That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
An evil vet?	No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.	An evil petting zoo?
Did you ever...	Of course not. I was married to your father.
Of course not. I was married to your father.	Did you ever want to?
We don't label people here, Scott.	No, he's really evil.
Well, it's kind of weird.	We don't judge here.
And how do you feel about that?	I don't wanna take over the family business.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.	Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.	Promised? Who promised?
Have we met?	You mean you don't recall??
You are female?	As you see.
As you see.	Then you can't come in.
Then you can't come in.	I have an appointment.
I have an appointment.	No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.	Really -- what happened in 1922?
May I help you, madam ...	Mr. John Steed, please.
Mr. John Steed, please.	I'm afraid that's impossible.
This isn't a game.	Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.	Rules are made to be broken.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...	We have met ...
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?	Eh? In here!
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...	Thank you, Steed.
The Institute ... the funding ...	A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
What are you trying to do to me?	We want to help...!
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?	Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --	Let me guess -- 'Father'?
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.	Valentine, listen to me ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...	I'm already married ...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...	An unholy trinity ...
An unholy trinity ...	You killed my husband.
Of course. I planned that, too.	But -- why?
'Our revels now are ended.'	Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.	Thanks, Valentine ...
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?	Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.	It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.	Our little paradise -- just made for two?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'	'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'	A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...	Still a bit chilly ...
Have you any place in mind?	As a matter of fact I have ...
What kept you?	The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
I'll be back ...	Where are you going?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.	'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Trubshaw again? What now?	Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
What is it?	Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
What's that you're wearing?	It's called Black Leather.
It's called Black Leather.	Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...	Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --	You didn't tell her?
Aren't you coming?	I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.	Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Why's he called 'Invisible'?	You'll find out.
No idea who. No idea why ...	Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...	... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.	Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
No, after you.	You don't trust me?
You don't trust me?	As far as you trust me.
But you did suspect me.	Not for a moment.
Not for a moment.	You're playing games.
You're playing games.	Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?	I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you played by the rules.	I thought you didn't.
I thought you didn't.	I'm playing to win.
I'm playing to win.	Winning isn't everything.
Winning isn't everything.	Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.	After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Mmm ... what are you doing?	Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?	Is that all?
Because you always obey orders ...	Always.  Except ...
Steed ... !	Mrs. Peel ... ?
This must be the last straw.	Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.	Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.	I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Is that what you think?	Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Three agents killed by bad weather...	... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Not quite. This is my field.	Is there anything that isn't?
But if someone miniaturized the process...	That's what we were working on.
That's what we were working on.	Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Is that written in his shoe?	Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...	She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.	How on earth can you tell?
I must say, you look more your old self --	You mean my other self ...
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?	Did you say formal? I must dress.
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?	You should be dead.  How do you feel?
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?	Small talk.  Try the weather.
June, July ... August?	The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.	Any other vices?
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?	As per mother's instructions.
As per mother's instructions.	Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?	For a man in my position --
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...	Do you really think so?
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...	Thank you, Trubshaw ...
My father always wanted a boy.	Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.	I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.	A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
... Showers followed by sunny periods.	We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
I was about to throw in the towel.	I had a spot of bother at the door.
I had a spot of bother at the door.	I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --	1922. Why the kippers?
1922. Why the kippers?	Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?	So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Doctor Peel, I presume?	And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
Privately owned by ...	Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.	Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...	I shall need a small plane.
I shall need a small plane.	You're not venturing alone, surely.
I was getting to it.	Getting to what?
Who's now vanished.	Makes two of us.
Peter's brother?  But --	Half-brother to be precise.
How did you guess?	You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Oh, hello ...	We want Mrs. Peel.
We want Mrs. Peel.	Dead, I'm afraid.
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.	So you say ...
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --	Guilty until proven innocent?
Guilty until proven innocent?	Mother and Father know best.
Possibly. Split personality ...	Insane ... ?
Weather's turning nasty.	You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.	Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.

Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.	I feel sure of it.

Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...	No, please! I beg you ...
No, please! I beg you ...	Walk over to the window ...
Walk over to the window ...	Let it be rain, please let it be --
Let it be rain, please let it be --	Stay by the window. By the window.
Aren't you forgetting about something?	You are, and it's behind you.
You said ... one shot.	Did I? My mistake.
One shot -- for emergencies.	That's not playing by the rules.
That's not playing by the rules.	Rules are made to be broken.
Rules are made to be broken.	If you say so.
You're better than I expected.	I was at Harrow ...
I was at Harrow ...	But did they teach you this?
The last one you'll ever see.	Perish the thought.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.	Check out the other guy's buns.
Does Cole know about this?	Really -- you went with him for two years.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.	Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
That's what we're going to find out...	I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.	Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.	Chulo, one thing at a time.
Chulo, one thing at a time.	Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?	Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.	Yeah. What is it?
Man, you're losing your audience.	Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?	We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.	I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.	Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?	You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!	Maybe it had something to do.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.	So does Debbie.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.	The car for Debbie?
The car for Debbie?	I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.	Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?

What's Debbie's blue book value right now?	Five thousand dollars.
Yes I did.	Fine. How's everything going?
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.	Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Thanks for the advise, sir.	Keep me informed.
Yes, sir, I am.	Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.	I've tried to change her mind.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?	Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
I'm going now, Cole.	I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
Cole, we've got to talk.	Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?	No, Cole, I...
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?	Let's get naked.
I don't believe you.	You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Let go of me!	Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
I can't trust you!	C'mon, I knew it was you.
C'mon, I knew it was you.	Rick, you're lying!
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.	Why don't you get undressed.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.	Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.	I love you.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.	Your mother's not dead.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.	Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...	You're really pissing me off.
This is it, lady. Last stop.	Can't I just go with you guys?
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.	What's the matter?
What's the matter?	I don't know... I just feel scared.
I can't sleep.	Oh... I got something for that.
Are you going to have women at your party?	No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.	I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.	Oh, those. Why do you ask?
God, you're a slob.	But a fabulous cook.
But a fabulous cook.	What are we having?
Ilene, are you crazy?	I know what I'm doing... Go!
Ilene, Rick promised...	Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
I hope Ilene's all right.	I hope those guys are all right.
A strange wang right in my palm.	Ilene, we don't really know that.
Why is Cole here?	You know your father enjoys his company.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.	Any time, Al.
Great bathing suit.	I think I screwed that one once.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?	A real turd.
A real turd.	Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Give him the works.	That's more like it.
That's it, prick lips.	What are you...
What are you...	I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?	What are you talking about, asshole?
What are you talking about, asshole?	Your whores never showed up.
Your whores never showed up.	They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.	They'll be up there in a half hour.
They'll be up there in a half hour.	Okay. Nice to meet you both.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?	Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.	I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.	What's going on?
What can I be doing for you?	You're a pimp?
You're a pimp?	I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.	I want women.
I'll take some.	Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.	Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.	Larry, you and your wife got problems?
What the hell are you doing?	I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.	You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?	I couldn't find any razor blades.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.	C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.	I just want to be alone.
You want to share it?	Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
It's on the tenth floor.	What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.	I'd love that.
Ed... you're kinky!	The phone made me do it!
The phone made me do it!	You've been having strange sex...!
You've been having strange sex...!	No, Brett, I...
No, Brett, I...	It's all right...  So have I.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.	No. Let's at least finish the set.
Reach out and snort someone.	I'm saved. Let's party!
Hey, you guys...	Who's your friend?
How 'bout this?	Still drawing a blank.
Who was that?	I don't know.
I think you'll enjoy this table.	So long, Father.
What the hell is that?	My gift to you.
My gift to you.	Under the table!
Under the table!	The best table in the house.
I'm not really hungry.	C'mon. I insist.
"We'll spend an hour with ""Nymphos Without Pants""..."	Olivier's in that, right?
Olivier's in that, right?	Then it's on to the real thing.
What's the matter?	Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Where the hell is he?	Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.	Right... Think it over.
You're late again, Rick.	I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.	There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...	Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
Biggest in two battalions.	We're gonna be okay, man...
Wash it to the windows?	No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.	It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
You gotta let me finish --	Just come down, John. Just --
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.	My Lt. might have something to say about that.
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...	I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
What are we going to do about this?	I'll handle it.
I'll handle it.	We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.	I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.

Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?	I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
Hey, what are you doing here?	Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.	Thanks for the insight.
Thanks for the insight.	Brian, look --

Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.	Sheep don't count.
Sheep don't count.	Yeah? What about Laura --
Yeah? What about Laura --	That was never proved.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.	What, you've never seen one before?
What, you've never seen one before?	In the Field Museum once.
I like what you've done with the place.	It's comin' along... want a beer?
It doesn't go like that.	Who asked you?
I quit two days ago, Brian.	What'll you do?
What'll you do?	I don't have the slightest idea...
I don't have the slightest idea...	I'll see ya around, huh?
I'll see ya around, huh?	It's a small town.
What is --	Just take it.
I don't know anything about it.	You could check. It'd be in his files.
You could check. It'd be in his files.	Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Then why did you quit?	I wanted to be a good one.
Thanks for the invite.	Got anything to drink in there?
Got anything to drink in there?	Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.	In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?	You think that's really any of your business?
You think that's really any of your business?	Well, you did invite me here.
Well, you did invite me here.	Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
I could use a date.	Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.	C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
With grenadine, right?	When I was twenty.

Oh Jesus Christ...	Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Then who --	-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.	I don't have a story.
I don't have a story.	Sure you do.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...	How ya feeling?
But the right guess on this is arson.	I don't guess.
"""Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"""	-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.

Aren't you even curious?	Engine 115, right?
Engine 115, right?	How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Completely out of control.	What the hell are we waiting for?

I'll be there.	They're waitin' man.
They're waitin' man.	I'll be there, goddamn it!
He just wants to --	-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?

How long has my father been like this?	Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.	So he drank himself into a stuper?
Don't make me have to use this.	I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.

What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.	Everybody shut up.
Who's side are you on?	I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
We both lied to him.	What do you want me to say?

Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.	Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
Where are you from?	Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Let Myrna finish.	Thank you.  And always smile.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.	The best defense is offense.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.	Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.

I fell out of my bed last night.	You slept too near where you got in?
You slept too near where you got in?	I slept too near where I fell out.

Say what, Manray?	Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
You're sure this is a good idea.	My people love me.
Why don't you call him?	For what?  He left.  Not me.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.	We can look out for ourselves.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.	Oh you do, huh?
Oh you do, huh?	Just a little something' somethin'.
Just a little something' somethin'.	I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.	Gots no intention of ending up broke.
No, before my time.	You don't read, do you?
You don't read, do you?	Never read a book in my whole life.
Never read a book in my whole life.	Maybe you need to start.
Maybe you need to start.	Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
So what's up with you?	What do you want to know?
What do you want to know?	The good stuff.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.	Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Where are you bound for?	That is none of your business.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.	I never was more in earnest.
Has he sent the challenge yet?	Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
I have acted as I think fit.	Sir, I'm a British officer.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.	The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Is Miss Dugan well?	There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.	Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?	Your cousins go out with him.
I have no luggage.	The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Good gracious!  What is this?	You are going to drive to the frontier.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.	Your honor must lower his voice.
Your honor must lower his voice.	All Europe shall hear of this!
All Europe shall hear of this!	As you please.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?	I will let down the steps for your honor.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.	I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
I believe they will deport you.	I have faced that problem before.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.	Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.	For whom else have you worked?
Who else can give me information about you?	Only the agency of servants.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
That is a trifle strong.	Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
You want my heart?	It is my only object.
It is my only object.	To make me wretched in two weeks.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?	Not even that.
Have you not a man whom you value?	That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Why are you shaking?	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
I feel the ribbon.	Then you must get it.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.	All right, five hundred guineas.
As much as possible.	As much as possible?
As much as possible?	Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.	All the same, you must name an amount.
Then this must be done tomorrow.	What is to be done?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.	The Prince left him only that choice.
May I be quite frank with you?	Yes, of course.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.	Is he all right, papa?
Is he all right, papa?	Yes, he's fine.
Good night, papa.	Good night, my little darling.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?	Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?	I beg your pardon?
And he doesn't care about me?	He is only curious to know who you are.
He loves me, as I love you.	Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Can I at least have a drink?	It's ten thirty in the morning.
It's ten thirty in the morning.	Yeah, if you've slept.
What about Pike?	Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Did -- did you --	It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --	What do we do?
What do we do?	Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
Don't you ever point a gun at me!	I'm -- I'm sorry...
West was one thing, but this --	Shut up, Mueller.
We got -- I don't know, we got separated	Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --	I don't know!
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --	Can anybody hear me!
We're not finished yet --	You wanna bet?
You saved Kendall's life --	But not Pike's.
I apologize --	You saw West's body.
You saw West's body.	Of course --
I didn't shoot West --	Yeah, we know, Pike did.
That son of a bitch.	That'd be my reaction too --
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?	I'm not telling you what happened.
There's no need...	They're dead, aren't they?
It's... too slow.	Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.	I just don't like it.
I just don't like it.	What do you like then?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...	How do you know that?
What the fuck is going on?	Your weapons, Sergeant.
Sir, yes, sir!	The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
Cadet, what's your name!	Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, Dunbar, sir!	You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?	Sir, yes, sir!
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.	So did we. Why didn't you come?
Jesus, what happened?	West... he's dead.
I... I don't know...	What don't you know?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.	You saw West, right? How was he killed?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?	Full clip to the body --
Full clip to the body --	From up close or far away?
From up close or far away?	His chest was hamburger --
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.	You're lying --
You're lying --	Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
That's exactly what he says about you.	Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
You hated West more than any of us.	Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --	You're the only one missing a grenade.
Roberto, what the fuck?	We just want to check your pack --
Whose blood is that, Jay?	West's. Any kindling for afire?
I don't know --	Where are they!
How do you know?	Because I was standing next to him.
But you didn't.	No. Poetic justice, though.
"What happened to ""degrees""?"	I didn't kill him --
I didn't kill him --	Then who did?
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.	But not the only victim, right?
Stay where you are.	Or what? You've gone round the bend --
You're a good soldier, Bill.	I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
That's horseshit and you know it.	Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
What I said before --	Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Tom, where are you going --	Home, I'm done.
Home, I'm done.	What about the confession?
You mean not enough to save you.	JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.	There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.	Not for me.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.	Who killed Pike?
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?	Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
What are you doing out here?	Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
That's not true.	There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.	You're a good man, Hardy.
No bodies, no West...	No death certificates. No crime.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --	WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
Hardy, what are you doing --	Isn't this how your story goes?
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.	Right back where we started.
I pushed him too hard.	You couldn't have known --
You couldn't have known --	Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.	You wanted to get the truth.
We're fucked, I know --	They got their stories straight.
Are you sure?	Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
At least you and Kendall agree on that.	What happened next?
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?	I don't know.
"""Too neat."" How long have you been an investigator?"	I don't think that has anything to do with --
Being back here. Gives me the willies.	Not the happiest of memories?
I plan to grow on you.	You're off to a late start.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.	Something like that. You?
Something like that. You?	I lost a bet.
You're right. We should sit in silence.	We're in the middle of a murder case --
We're in the middle of a murder case --	Best time for banal chit-chat.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --	You made me look like an idiot --
Good cop/bad cop?	Something like that.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --	Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Is Dunbar cute?	That is the most unprofessional --
You knew Sergeant West?	He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
Hostile and uncooperative.	Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
I was freezing from the hurricane --	So you took off your shirt?
Pike and I got separated --	Yeah and he doesn't know when --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --	I remember now, it was before the explosion --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --	Oh, you remember now --
Maybe we shouldn't go.	The faggot speaks.
The faggot speaks.	You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?	You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Dunbar's telling the truth.	Wrong answer --
Pike never confessed.	We've been making progress, I see.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.	Because he'd shot Mueller.
Because he'd shot Mueller.	But you didn't see it, right?
He said what?	"""You're gonna die tonight, faggot"". Clear as day."
"""You're gonna die tonight, faggot"". Clear as day."	No one else heard it?
No one else heard it?	He whispered it in my ear.
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --	We're not going anywhere.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?	I used it to start the fire --
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?	Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --	You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...	The army kicked you out for drugs...
What do you think?	It's too neat.
He's not Army, it's not official --	Then it's unofficial.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.	Who is she? Where does she live?
Who is she? Where does she live?	Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
You won't find a better place!	I don't expect to.
You get the eye?	I brought it.
I brought it.	Let's see it.
Or are you too scared?	I'll go in right now and get that eye.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.	Then do it.
Then do it.	Fine, I will.
Fine, I will.	Fine, you do it.
Fine, you do it.	Fine, I'm doing it.
How long have you known my father?	Thirty years. Maybe more.
Thirty years. Maybe more.	How would you describe him?
Can I see him?	Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
Lord, I'm sorry I...	Please. Go. Just go.
It's okay, just leave it.	I can get it. I can just...
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.	I see. I thank you for your time.
Helping people makes me happy.	I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.	I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
You must be Edward Bloom.	How did you know?
Promise me you'll come back.	I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?	I suspect it will hurt a lot.
Did you see that woman?	What did she look like?
What did she look like?	Well, she... uh...
Well, she... uh...	Was she nekkid?
There was one time when I was eleven...	You were talking about your wedding.
I like your stories.	And I like you.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?	Well, it's not a short one.
Spooning the sherbet.	Can I take your picture?
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.	No, I understand.
No, I understand.	He was slipping her a little extra cream.
Hi. How are you feeling?	I was dreaming.
I was dreaming.	What were you dreaming about?
You're not trying to run away?	Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Tell me how it happens.	How what happens?
How what happens?	How I go.
You think I'm fake.	Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.	I think someone hasn't.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.	Oh, so you know.
When did you ever work in an office?	There's a lot you don't know about me.
What did he say?	You owe me three-fifty.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.	The Old Lady by the swamp.
The Old Lady by the swamp.	She was a witch.
She was a witch.	No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
So how does it happen?	Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
You think I'm up for it?	You learned from the best.
How can I convince you to stop?	Go out with me.
You don't even know me.	I have the rest of my life to find out.
They're your favorite flower.	How did you get so many?
So what are you up to now?	I'm robbing this place.
This is why you don't show work in progress.	Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?	I can't imagine any place better than here.
Wait! I need those!	There is no softer ground than town.
I'm going to check on him.	I need to lie down for a bit.
I'm going to get started on dishes.	I'll help you.
Do you love your father?	Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.	Do you love him?
You never told me how your parents met.	They met at Auburn.
That's because most of it never happened.	But it's romantic.
I'm going with you.	You don't have to.
You don't have to.	I'm going with you.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.	You need to go.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?	Yes. Thank you.
Is he awake?	He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
That really happened?	Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
Was she one of your teachers?	No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.	Do you know who that is?
Would you say you understand Josephine?	Yes. But that's a different...
How much time does he have left?	You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?	He's up with your father.
How did you get here?	We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.	Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.	We rented a car.
We rented a car.	You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff	I paid for those guitar cases.
You know what for.	No I don't.
No I don't.	I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.	No I haven't.
What? What are you doing?	What are you doing here?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.	That's not a burn.
That's not a burn.	It is. I did it cooking.
It's enough isn't it?	What do you mean?
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.	There's over eighty thousand here.
Just leave her alone.	I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.	Leave her alone.
He wants a lot of money.	I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...	He wants the money from your bank.
He wants the money from your bank.	I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
I understand. I'm so sorry	You can stay tonight.
How is bank?	Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.	To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
No. It's not that.	Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?	I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
No. It is too judgmental.	Tell me what he said.
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!	Uh. Do you like England?
Uh. Do you like England?	Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
So how long will you be in England?	Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.	You must have a visa or something...
You must have a visa or something...	You're asking for my documents?
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?	Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
I need to know who you are first please.	Oh.  We are Russian.
Oh.  We are Russian.	Yes. I know.
What did he say?	He says he feels safe here.
Sorry. You've lost me...	I'm asking what you're here for.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?	Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
My name's Sophia.	Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
What does it mean?	Maybe you will find out.
I'm not asking you to marry me.	No. What? No. I know.
No. What? No. I know.	It's more like a date.
It's more like a date.	It's a long way to go for a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.	Tell me about it.
It's not mine.	It's not mine either.
It's not mine either.	It's what you came back for.
You can probably buy them on the flight.	I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Yeah. No thanks.	Please. Why not?
Please. Why not?	Because it was a lie.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?	No. I think I better just go.
No. I think I better just go.	Okay. Thank you.
I don't know.	What was her name?
What was her name?	What's your name?

I don't want anyone to die.	Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.	Except for Small Eyes.
She's alive!! She is not dead?	Laugh it up.
Are you scared?	Not really. Maybe a little.
Thank Christ for that.	You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I don't have nothing.	Well what have you got?
You don't have to say anything	What? I... I wasn't saying...
What? I... I wasn't saying...	Please, there's no... Oh.
Please, there's no... Oh.	I wasn't saying anything.
You don't understand me.	You don't understand you either.
I got what I paid for.	You didn't mind too much.
Some... What does that mean?	There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
So now you hate all women?	I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
We'll pretend it never happened.	So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?	I don't hate you.
And? What are you saying?	And. It's wrong.
And. It's wrong.	And who says what is wrong.
Shut up. I'm not listening.	You don't want to talk about it.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...	I don't want to talk about him.
Give me some money.	I don't have any money.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...	What? No you're not..

In the world.	I know you just want to punish me --
I know you just want to punish me --	I do. I want to very badly.
I do. I want to very badly.	So you're just going to be vindictive
So you're just going to be vindictive	In every sense. If at all possible.
In every sense. If at all possible.	You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
It's makes it easier. Okay.	I don't want to know.
I don't understand.	Happy bath day.
Is the flight full?	I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.	Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.

That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...	Now, hold up.
Heard about this morning.	We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.	Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.	This all looks wonderful.
Goin' dove huntin'?	You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.	You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?	He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.	Why's his britches round his knees?

I just wanted some make-up.	All that shit's on aisle 5.
What happened to your face?	Got in a little accident.
Alright. How much you need, ho?	The hell you call me?
The hell you call me?	Eh, if the bootie fits...
You got any money?	Thought you had a man for that.
Thought you had a man for that.	I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.	He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.	I don't think he'd feel it.
Getting very weird.	I'd feel better if we had some heat.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.	Maybe we should bail?
This the right place?	I hope not.
This should be it...	You said that in the last two places.
Let's grab some food.	First decent idea you've had.
Nick, we can't just --	I said let's go, Charlie.
Hey, when in Rome --	In Rome, I'll bow.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.	I didn't know.
Go to sleep, Charlie.	You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
Nick, have I been a good partner?	Number five with a bullet.
What'd you say?	Where is the subway station, please.
What are you doing?	Saving your life.
What are they doing now?	Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.	Who do you think the Jap is?
Who do you think the Jap is?	Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --	-- I should tear your head off.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?	What does Charlie mean?
What does Charlie mean?	Hey, all right.
Joyce can be nice.	What'd she say?
Are you expecting anyone?	I wasn't expecting you.
All right, how's the new partner?	High spirits, desire, commitment.
High spirits, desire, commitment.	You'll take care of that.
You'll take care of that.	Give me a break, would you?
Give me a break, would you?	If you give me one.
Think we'll get him, Nick?	We can't lose.
We can't lose.	How can you be so sure?
Louder, pal, louder.	Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
Thank you.  You have one?	A wife.  She left.
Someone attacked him.	Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.	How many men?
How many men?	I couldn't tell.
I don't know.	We need the plate to negotiate with.
Let's go.  Him first.	Nick, you can't do this.
Nick, you can't do this.	It's done.  You don't have to come.
It's illegal, Nick.	It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Where does this Sugai live?	A resort city, Beppu.
A resort city, Beppu.	I want to go talk to him.
I want to go talk to him.	What...?  Why?
What...?  Why?	Because he knows how to get to our man.
Because he knows how to get to our man.	He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.	I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
I want to yank Kobo.	Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
She disappeared... shit!	You were too far behind.
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...	Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Did I say that?	You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.	Are we getting married?
What'd I tell you?	There she is!
How'd you get this?	I stole them.
I've continued working on the case!	I can see that.
Why weren't you at the platform?	I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.	Why the hell not?
Why the hell not?	I don't, that's all.
Give us a break...	It's Ichiro.  Ich.
It's Ichiro.  Ich.	Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.	That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
Where do we start looking for this guy?	Where would you look for the mafia?
Might be different in New York.	Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.	I'd like that.
I still think you're a bastard.	What if I chant?
What if I chant?	Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
You'll get Ich killed.	No one's keeping him here.
They want your autograph.	Who am I supposed to be?
I don't remember saying yes.	I don't remember you saying no.
Where's the wife?	You met her.
I need someone to translate for me.	My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
And I'm supposed to care?	You could fake it.
Don't be an ass.	He's on duty.
He's on duty.	I paid for that.
She ever pull down her shades?	Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.	I don't think so.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.	You have a helluva way of answering.
Ich said you left.	There was a change in plans.
Don't give him any more.	He gets as much as he wants.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.	Then take it from him.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.	Guess I'm on a roll.
Guess I'm on a roll.	She's such a long way home for you.
She's such a long way home for you.	Time, I've got plenty of.
Keep the change.	I'm taking you back.
It's not your job.	He was my partner.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.	What...?  What if I say no?
How big a package we talking about?	This by this...
You had my help, detective.	If anything happens to her while I'm here --
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!	Twenty-four hours, detective.
Could you fill me in?	Why don't you ask your chief detective?
I want a gun.	It is not allowed.
It is not allowed.	We're police officers.
That wasn't our deal.	You want him dead too.
You want him dead too.	After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
You trust me?	I'll pay you.
I want him.	He'll be dealt with.
One man.  He must be good.	Then go get him.
Then go get him.	That wouldn't be very sporting.
What's the point?	Not to be trapped.
Not to be trapped.	You underestimate the trap, Mary.
He knows what he's doing.	If he won't cooperate?
I've done some questionable things.	Also extraordinary things.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.	It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.	And what can he do for you?
And what can he do for you?	Can the maker repair what he makes?
Can the maker repair what he makes?	Would you like to be modified?
Would you like to be modified?	Had in mind something a little more radical.
Had in mind something a little more radical.	What's the problem?
Where are you going, Sebastian?	Just thought I'd...
His company made us.	I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Of course not.	You could help us.
What generation are you?	Nexus - 6.
Why are you staring at us?	You're just all so... so different.
I think, therefore I am.	Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.	Hello, glad to meet you.
What's going on down there?	He's not ready yet.
I didn't like her.	You didn't like her!?
Well, when do you get paid?	Soon as I finish the job.
Soon as I finish the job.	When might that be?
When might that be?	Day after tomorrow.
Day after tomorrow.	Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
It's gotta be right for my customer.	Your customer, eh?
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...	Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?	Longevity is classified.  No.
Do you have something against science?	Not if it works.
Not if it works.	And what in your estimation works?
I know all that.	What about a summary then.
What about a summary then.	I think we're through for the night.
You equipped for random questions?	Why, yes, of course.
How old am I?	I don't know.
I like you.	I like you too.
I like you too.	One more, eh?
One more, eh?	I gotta piss.
You want to see my friends?	Sorry, don't have the time.
I think I have no money.	It's okay.  Forget it.
It's okay.  Forget it.	But I would like to buy you drink.
But I would like to buy you drink.	I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Shot of vodka, please.	Thank you very much.
No.  I got a problem.	Let's hear it.
Let's hear it.	I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
What if you change your mind?	They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.	Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
It's a good job.	You mean the snake.
What difference will it make?	Just wait here.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.	Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?	No, I don't.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?	You mean a woman?
You're sick, Deckard.	I never felt better.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...	Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.	But then how can you...
They could clean around the arrangement.	I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?	Don't be fooled by appearances.
Do you dream?	Yeah.  Sometimes.
Yeah.  Sometimes.	I wish I could.
What do people do in the afternoon?	If they are smart, they take naps.
How are you doing?	Not too good.
Who is this?	Me and my dad.
Me and my dad.	Where is he?
You ever take a bath with a man before?	There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
I can imagine.	Can you?  I couldn't.
Two of us might be more effective than one.	I work alone.
I've already got more help than I need.	I think you need more help than you've got.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.	In your opinion.
In your opinion.	It would be my child.
It would be my child.	Sounds like you speaks from experience.
Are you apprehensive?	Why should I be?
Where the hell you been?	You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?	Five, maybe six.
If she is, the machine works.	The machine works.  She is.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?	Sitting next to you.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?	I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.	But how come I'd be there?
A tortoise.  What's that?	Know what a turtle is?
What makes you think so?	You're all so perfect.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.	I keep a lot of provisions right here.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.	Is that why you're still here?
Is that why you're still here?	Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
And you live in this building all by yourself?	Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?	We sure did.
You want to go home?	I don't have one.
How come you were in my truck?	I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.	Your mom was a dancer?
This is my new friend...	I'm Adam Webber.
I'm Adam Webber.	He's really funny!
Oh, now, that's a great one!	You like it?
For how long?	Well, that depends...
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.	How do you do?
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.	It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.	Eve? I'm leaving.
It was at least as good as the sky.	Really?  Okay!
Really?  Okay!	And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.	Is that what you call it?
I know first aid!	Well, you had better!!
I'm leaving, too.	But, Eve, I would--
I don't blame you!	Eve, I'm sorry.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?	Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Okay. I like that.	Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
What have you ordered?	It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
I thought I was here to meet women.	Not that one!
Not that one!	I like her.
I like her.	And don't be so obvious!
No!  Not crazy!	Do I look crazy?
Where's he gone?	He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.	He has a computer?
I thought only hookers drank those things.	Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
You almost got us killed!	I told you I've never driven before!
I told you I've never driven before!	Never drive again!
Never drive again!	You said it would be easy!
You said it would be easy!	I was wrong!!
I was wrong!!	Is this your house?
I don't want to be alone.	You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
One who's not a mutant.	No dogs, huh? Okay.
No dogs, huh? Okay.	And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.	Oh, I'm sure it will!
Oh, I'm sure it will!	Then forget it.
Then forget it.	No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?	This is for me.
This is for me.	Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
I guess we'll need another locker.	No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.	Hey, you know. I was thinking...
They like Dr. Pepper.	Who are these people?
Who are these people?	My Mom and Dad.
My Mom and Dad.	Very funny, smart ass.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.	How long would you need me?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?	Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Watching television in color.	Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Hey, no kidding?  In color?	Cross my heart and hope to die.
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?	Okay!  Damn!
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.	Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Why are you doing that?	I haven't brushed yet.
I haven't brushed yet.	Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
I can't, it's yours.	Take it. damn it!
Hey, what are you doing?!	I know a short-cut.
Wait!  Wait!	What is it?!
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?	It's Webber.  Adam Webber.

What's wrong with you?	I just had a mental picture of...
I just had a mental picture of...	Here, pick these up!
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?	Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.

I've got to go, now.	Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
How do I leave here?	The front door is open.  Will you be back?
That's what everybody believes?	Yes, sir. It's true.
But, I don't understand.	And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.	Well, in that case...of course, son.
"Also...stay out of the ""Adult Bookstore."""	Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Adult Bookstore.  Why?	Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.	I promise. Is that all?
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...	Yes, father?! Yes?
Yes, father?! Yes?	...the pipe tobacco.

I don't think so.	You don't have a computer in your cabin?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!	That would knock my father out.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.	He's a Windows guy then, huh?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?	Yes. He likes windows.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!	Sorry, that's the largest city.

We have to go.	No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
Are you in trouble, son?!	I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
I'm afraid you've got to.	I'll be all right.

What'd he get?	Pretty much everything.
Pretty much everything.	The grandfather clock?
Dignan, it's too late.	I don't think so.
I'll see you there.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	I'll get him.
I'll get him.	There's not enough time.

It's going back down.	Applejack! What's happening?
What's happening? What's going on?	It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
I don't know.	Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.	Good. It's supposed to be.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.	Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.	You're all clear.
We all set?	Hang on a second.
Do you like Inez?	As a person?
As a person?	Yeah. As a girl.
Yeah. As a girl.	Yes. I do.
Yes. I do.	So do I.
He was a nice guy.	He was all right.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.	I don't think you will.
I don't think you will.	I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.	Did that hurt?
Yeah. It's pretty good.	It's like we've finally arrived.
What the fuck are we doing out here?	I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.	I'm sorry, Bob.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.	Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
He doesn't want to fight.	Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.	No, Dignan. This isn't --
What do you think?	He seems pretty good.
You could give somebody a concussion.	Let me feel that.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?	Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
I want you to look at this.	What is it?
What is it?	It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.	What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Who's in the car?	That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
When'd you get back?	Ah. Couple days ago.
She needed it.	A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!	Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.	That's what she is!
That's what she is!	I know that. But --
I know that. But --	You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
I think we better go home.	Don't panic, Anthony.
Don't panic, Anthony.	I'm not. But there's --
We've got sixteen dollars.	That's not correct.
You don't know how to hotwire.	Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.	Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.	No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.	She doesn't need to know.
She doesn't need to know.	I don't know, Dignan. I just --
I wish I'd been there.	Would of been nice.
I can't believe he just jumped you.	Can you hand me those french fries.
Where was I?	You were asleep.
You were asleep.	He told you and you let him do it.
He went back for his brother.	We said 48 hours.
We said 48 hours.	That's a long time to be in jail.
That coward. Son of a bitch.	Maybe he just went to the store.
He's gone. He stole the car.	Where was it parked?
See, now we've got a plan.	Don't worry about it, Bob.
As long as he gets out OK.	Obviously. That's a given.
What the fuck is going on here?	What. What's the matter?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.	Which one was that?
Which one was that?	On the left.
Inez, this is --	Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.	No. We didn't.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.	I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
I'll just say it.	I'll say it.
I'll say it.	OK. Go ahead.
OK. Go ahead.	On your marks...  Get set go.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.	You were spoiled rotten.
See if mine are in there.	Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.	Yes, they are.
Yes, they are.	Look at the treads on those.
Look at the treads on those.	What about them?
What about them?	They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Can I get that credit card from you?	I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Because my mom gets the bill.	She's not going to notice, Anthony.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.	I don't want to use it.
I don't want to use it.	Well, then cut it in half.
Well, then cut it in half.	I keep it for emergencies.
What's wrong with him?	What do you think?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.	Like he meant it.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.	Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
Is that the manager?	Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Where's the manager?	Where's the other stocker?
Where's the other stocker?	There's another stocker, right?
There's another stocker, right?	We know there's another stocker.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.	You're right. You're right.
Dignan, calm down.	You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!	No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Loop around real fast.	Just turn right here.
But he didn't say anything.	Hang on a second.
It had an alarm.	Yeah, I heard that.
Yeah, I heard that.	Five, seven, eight dollars.
Did you see that?	Yeah, I saw it.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.	I don't think so. Just reach on in.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.	That sets it off.
Where are you going?	I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.	How was I ridiculing you?
It's got a V-8, Dignan.	What do you think the cops have?
She's really kind of hot.	She's an attractive older woman.
Did you see what I meant about the window?	Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.	That's true. But what if they change the locks?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?	Would they do that?
Would they do that?	Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
What does Starsky say?	He says. This is he.

Dignan, it's --	Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Plus where's Huggie Bear?	He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.	I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
We're renegades from despair.	Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
No, that door over there.	I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.	Are you afraid?
No. Bob did.	Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.	Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?	Anthony, I'm petrified.
Did Dignan take the test?	Yes, he did.
Yes, he did.	How'd he do?
How does that feel?	It feels good.
That was a test?	Take a deep breath.
Congratulations. You passed the test.	What do you mean?
This is my business manager, Rowboat.	Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.	That's a sharp jacket.
What are you doing?	My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.	Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Give him a second.	Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Yeah. Let's keep it --	Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Let's not even talk about it.	It was stupid.
Was Future Man adopted?	Jesus Christ! No.
Were you adopted, Bob?	Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?	Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.	No. I wasn't adopted.
Bob, where you going?	I'm not playing any more golf.
You think I'm improving?	Yes. You just got to stick with it.
You think he got my license plates?	He looked too shaken-up.
There's a million places to hide around here.	Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.	I hope not.
I hope not.	Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.	What was that?
Are you serious?	Yeah. He said that.
Let them fight.	Let them fight.
Could you grow cinnamon?	I don't know. Sure, I guess.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.	You could make your own cinnamon toast.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?	It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.	Hector woudn't do anything.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?	God, yes. Like silk.
How do you say nineteen?	Dies y nueve.
Where'd they come from?	The front stairs.
The front stairs.	Where were you?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.	You don't celebrate til it's over.
Wait. Did he see us?	We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Is that him?	Wait a second.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.	The one and only Little Richard.
Are you a fag?	You're the faggot.
Hold on --	Here we go.
Here we go.	Wait a second --
Do they let you --	I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Do you have your own room?	We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.	Do you have your own cell?
Do you have your own cell?	No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?	I didn't think there was an alarm.
I didn't think there was an alarm.	Take him to the car, Bob.
Is he breathing?	I think so.
What's wrong with Applejack?	He's having a heart attack or something.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?	It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.	Stand by. Bird Dog?
Come on, Bob.	I know it, man. Hang on.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.	I didn't have any choice.
You said 48 hours!	I never agreed to that.
I never agreed to that.	Bob, you're lying!
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?	Man, I don't want to go into this.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.	Yeah. It is.
Come on in. What you been up to?	Not a whole lot, Bob.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.	I know it's not.
I know it's not.	You don't even know his name.
You don't even know his name.	Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.	What is it?
What is it?	Just get in the car, Bob.
Just get in the car, Bob.	What's his name?
Give me the keys, Dignan.	I can't do that, Bob.
What do you mean get back?	Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.	Bob, that makes no sense.
Bob, that makes no sense.	Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.	This could be a trap.
This could be a trap.	Come on, Dignan.
Come on, Dignan.	"Don't ""Come on, Dignan"" me."
"Don't ""Come on, Dignan"" me."	I'm going back.
I'm going back.	Not in that car you're not.
How long has he been in there?	I don't know.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.	That could be anybody's.
That could be anybody's.	They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?	They said he's a drug dealer.
You can go first, Bob.	My brother's in jail.
My brother's in jail.	What are you talking about?
Bob. Are you coming?	See you in a little while.
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.	It's registered in my mother's name.
It's registered in my mother's name.	What the fuck possessed you?
What the fuck possessed you?	You're the one who kept saying ram him.
Is he chasing us?	I don't know.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?	He wouldn't move.
Way to go, Bob!	I told you they were there.
I told you they were there.	So it's my fault?
That's true. That would give me nightmares.	Bob, I've got nightmares.
Bob, will you please listen?	I don't want to talk about it.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!	No. I was calm.
How much is there?	Don't count it.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.	This is natural.
This is natural.	That's good. Keep it at forty.
That's good. Keep it at forty.	Did we get it?
Did we get it?	Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
What are you doing?	I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
His name was Swifty?	Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.	That's too bad.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!	I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
That's my responsibility.	That's your domain.
I think we might of scared her.	Let's just go.
Where'd she go?	Maybe she turned.
The guy is fucking insane.	I warned you, Dignan.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.	I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.	Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.	I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
What was that all about?	I can't believe you said that.
I can't believe you said that.	What did I say?
What did I say?	I told you he's crazy.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.	You're paranoid, Bob.
You're paranoid, Bob.	Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
You stole a Trans-Am.	Yes. I did.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.	What are you talking about, Bob?
What are you talking about, Bob?	Can you use a coaster.
That never would of --	Let's cut the bullshit.
I'm not allowed to drive those.	Not even for emergencies?
Well, what do you think?	I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.	Yeah. Hey, Clay.
How's that 700 bucks coming?	I'm working on it.
He said what?	He said you ran away from home.
He said you ran away from home.	No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.

This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.	This is no good.
What's the story?	Can't get it. It won't...
Can't get it. It won't...	What can we do?
Where is he? Where is Rob?	I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.	You got that?
We're closed, sir.	Where's that guy going?
Where's that guy going?	He left his sweater.
He left his sweater.	Well, I left some money in there.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.	No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.	Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
I don't know.	She is a good looking woman.
You a good pool player.	Got a little lucky.
Got a little lucky.	Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?	No. I just have short hair.
No. I just have short hair.	Is that your chiquita?
Is that your chiquita?	No, my friend knows her.
No, my friend knows her.	She Chicano, yes?
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.	Pleasure to meet you, John.
Pleasure to meet you, John.	Nice to meet you.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.	Good to know you, John.
You told me Bourne was dead.	There was a mistake.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.	I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.	'Why' would be enough for me.
'Why' would be enough for me.	I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.	And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.	Why not? It was just money.
Why not? It was just money.	And Danny Zorn, what was that?
And Danny Zorn, what was that?	Had to be done.
Had to be done.	No good options left?
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.	Did he say anything to you?
Did he say anything to you?	No... It must have been Bourne.
Sorry to wake you.	I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
And what are we looking for?	I want to know about Treadstone.
Never heard of it.	That's not gonna fly.
Who else knows about this?	Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?	Show me again...
It was staged?	Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Lots of people...	Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
She say what time I should call?	The sooner the better.
I have to go now.	Is this really happening?
I can't let you do that either.	Because you're afraid!
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.	You're a liar.
You're a liar.	You know I'm not.
You know I'm not.	YOU'RE A LIAR!
YOU'RE A LIAR!	Look at me.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.	No. It's because you don't know how they died.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.	No, I do.
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]	I speak English.
-- car keys?	-- my coat -- but we should --
-- my coat -- but we should --	-- what? --
-- what? --	-- take the back -- get another car --
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Who sent you to Greece?
Who sent you to Greece?	A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know who that is.	What's going on in Berlin?
What's going on in Berlin?	I don't know! Why would I lie?
Front. Use your teeth.	Sorry. Old habits.
I emptied it.	Felt a little light.
I wanted to kill him.	But you found another choice.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.	It might have.
I love you, too.	Tell me later.
What if it's not who you think it is?	If he crosses the bridge, it is.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.	There must be another way!
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --	-- not yet --
-- not yet --	-- it's just him? --
Switch! You drive!	-- where? -
-- where? -	-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
...but you're not -- you're not sure...	We can't wait to be sure.
We can't wait to be sure.	I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- where's left to go? --	-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
But you're sure?	He was at the campground yesterday.
The Telegraph office.	But we were so careful.
But we were so careful.	We pushed it. We got lazy.
Sleep. Sleep now.	I should be better by now.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?	I worry when you get like this.
I worry when you get like this.	It's just a nightmare.
Where were you, Jason? In the car.	Conklin up front.
Conklin up front.	I'll get the book.
I'll get the book.	No. There's nothing new.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --	-- it hasn't been two years --
No... Jason... please...	I was here!
So when was I here?	What do you mean?
No. You never worked Berlin.	My first job.
My first job.	Your first assignment was Geneva.
Your first assignment was Geneva.	That's a lie!
That's a lie!	You never worked Berlin...
And you got to him before we could.	I killed him???
What is this, a game?	I want to hear it from you.
Who is Pamela Landy?	You hear me? I believed you.
You hear me? I believed you.	IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
Don't need it. I remember everything.	Sounds like a threat.
Sounds like a threat.	You didn't answer my question.
Why am I alive?	Are you disappointed?
Okay, how do you want to do it?	I want someone I know to take me in.
What do you want?	I want to come in.
-- go -- take the van! --	-- the hotel -- how far? --
Looks like he's been detained.	Who's going? Us?
We need to get in there.	I'm working on it.
-- who? -- who else is here? --	-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --	-- shut up! -- just shut the --
This is everything? Is there.	Is there. Is all there.
That's where we came out.	It's a lot of money, Pam.
How long have you worked for the agency?	Me? Four years.
Is it fresh?	It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Am I a doctor, no, but...	Are you an expert in amnesia?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.	So he fooled you.
So he fooled you.	If you say so.
Are we hacking or asking?	Yes. In that order.
Yes. In that order.	And what about you, anything?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.	Are we locked up?
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.	You've all sworn to Longshanks.
He won't come.	He will. I know he will.
Young Robert, we are honored --	My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.	Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
Wallace has sacked York!	Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!	I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Good day to you, M'Lords.	You mock us with a smile?
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!	...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
So I did! And what was so important about it?	Scotland. He intends --
Keep these. We're going too.	No. One of us is enough.
That's just a dream, William!	We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
The Bruce is not coming, William.	Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
I'll wait... back there.	Hamish, I... thank...
Good to see you again.	I should'a remembered the eggs.
Wanna stay with me tonight?	I wanna have supper waitin'.
I wanna have supper waitin'.	We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.	Aye, we'll get 'em.
We must run in different directions!	We don't split up!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.	So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
I have faced him. Have you?	Let her speak.
I want... to marry you!	I... accept your proposal!
I... accept your proposal!	I'm not just saying it!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.	You scare me.
This night is too beautiful to have again.	I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Did it work?	No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
Thank you for accepting.	Thank you for inviting.
Thank you for inviting.	I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.	You are. And I'll come again.
And I with you. But you must wake.	I need you so much! I love you!
I need you so much! I love you!	Wake up, William. Wake up!
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.	Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
You will die! It will be awful!	Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.	Peace is made is such ways.
Peace is made is such ways.	SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.	It's battle I want, not talk.
I am the Princess of Wales.	Wife of Edward, the king's son?
I must... consult with my father.	And I will consult with mine.
Come, it'll help you sleep.	Aye. But it won't let me dream.
Fine speech. Now what do we do?	Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!	No English lord would trust an Irishman!
We can't stop!	They've tricked us.
They've tricked us.	What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.	So what did you find.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!	Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.	You'd be surprised how often they are.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.	Why? What for?
Just. Like. Jason.	Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
I found these. The others are still in storage.	Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
How long will I be in here?	I don't know. These things take time.
I don't know. These things take time.	How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
I don't know... I don't remember.	Something must've happened! What set him off?
Something must've happened! What set him off?	I... I blacked out.
Honey. What were you doing with that?	I... I don't remember.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.	Great. I'll see you soon.
Um... can dad come this time?	You know the answer to that.
You know the answer to that.	Can't he come out for one day?
Just tell me if anything weird happens.	Weirder than this?
Weirder than this?	Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.	I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.	Can you protect me?
Are you hurting her?	No, protecting her.
Dad lives here?	Not in this wing, actually. No.
What the fuck are you doing?	Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.	I thought you were a December baby.
I thought you were a December baby.	This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Is something the matter?	Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
Sure you don't want your wallet?	Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.	I get it. You can drop it now.
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!	He's a fucking maniac!
Are you okay?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.	Go on. Sit down.
So it didn't feel... weird?	Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
Where... where are my clothes?	Those are your clothes, silly.
What do you want to know, Evan?	It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?	It was a long time ago.
It was a long time ago.	I know, but...
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.	Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.	Not if you remember my dad.
Not if you remember my dad.	Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Not since we were kids.	I've stopped a hundred times.
I've stopped a hundred times.	So how's Tommy?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?	He must be. They're letting him go, right?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.	You really don't remember anything that happened?
Oh God... what did we do?	Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!	Been there, done that.
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?	Calm down, kid. Stand still.
We're really gonna be in a movie!?	That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!	Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?	We'll find out soon enough.
Just don't drop the ball, okay?	I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.	Wow... read something.
Smells like sex in here.	Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.	You're kidding. He's so... big.
I couldn't cut the rope.	Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
That should buy you ten minutes at least.	Gee, thanks friend.
Can... can... Can I have this?	Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.	I think I'll go check out the chapel.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.	"Right, Evan. I believe you just said ""sick fuck."""
Look what you made me do!	What's wrong with you?!
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!	What happened?? Where are we?!
Hey, what'd you do that for?	Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
I come from a big family.	Meant no offense.
Meant no offense.	None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?	Sorry. Never heard of her.
Shut up, Tommy!	Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Lenny? Come on!	Oh my God oh my God...
I thought I was the bad guy!	You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?	Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Here you go, buddy.	What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Monsieur Rick, I --	-- He's just a lucky guy.
You want my advice?	Oh, yes, please.
Oh, yes, please.	Go back to Bulgaria.
And you want to know --	-- Will he keep his word?
-- Will he keep his word?	He always has.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?	Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.	No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
He did. Captain Renault did.	I thought so. Where's your husband?
How did you get in here? You're under age.	I came with Captain Renault.
I came with Captain Renault.	I should have known.
I should have known.	My husband is with me, too.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?	I'm sorry. It is.
What is your name?	Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
But Sacha always puts out that light --	-- Tonight he forgot.
-- Tonight he forgot.	Yes, I come, I will do it.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.	How long can I afford to stay closed?
How long can I afford to stay closed?	Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?	No thanks, Carl.
Here you are.	It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.	That's all right.
Er, goodbye, sir.	It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Here's to you, sir.	Er, good luck, yes.
Er, good luck, yes.	I'd better be going.
I'd better be going.	Er, my check, please.
Er, my check, please.	I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.	Well, so long.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?	Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.	It's not for sale.
It's not for sale.	You haven't heard my offer.
You haven't heard my offer.	It's not for sale at any price.
It's not for sale at any price.	What do you want for Sam?
What do you want for Sam?	I don't buy or sell human beings.
There are only two other alternatives for him.	What are they?
But why my name, Richard?	Because you're getting on that plane.
Because you're getting on that plane.	I don't understand. What about you?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.	I wish I didn't love you so much.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.	Put them on the table.
Richard, I had to see you.	"You use ""Richard"" again? We're back in Paris."
How did you get in?	The stairs from the street.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.	I don't think I will, Rick.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?	Has it got a wow finish?
Has it got a wow finish?	I don't know the finish yet.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.	Yes, of course, we --
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.	And I was wondering.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.	"I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said ""no questions."""
"We said ""no questions."""	Here's looking at you, kid.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.	Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.	Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.	I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.	"Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."""
Where is Rick?	I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
It's been a long time.	Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.	Some of the old songs, Sam.
Are you ready Ilsa?	Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
No, Victor, there isn't.	I love you very much, my dear.
Did he give any reason?	He suggested I ask you.
Our faithful friend is still there.	Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
What happened with Rick?	We'll discuss it later.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?	And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.	Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.	No, Victor, no.
This time they really mean to stop me.	Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.	We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
You are very kind.	Won't you join us?
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.	You're saying this only to make me go.
Well then, perhaps you also ---	-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
He came from Paris with Rick.	Rick? Who's he?
Rick? Who's he?	Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --	-- Is what?
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.	Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.	But we made a deal.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.	Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.	I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.	I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?	I said, ask your wife.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.	Not at all.
Thank you. I try.	We all try. You succeed.
How do you do?	How do you do?
How do you do?	One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.	And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.	Won't you join us for a drink?
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --	-- Thank you.
I believe you have a message for him?	Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.	Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
I slept very well.	That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.	May we proceed with the business?
May we proceed with the business?	With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.	We'll be there.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!	This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.	Yes. What is it you want?
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?	Ask Monsieur Rick.
What is the meaning of that phone call?	Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.	How do you do, Mr. Rick?
Champagne and a tin of caviar.	May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Good evening, gentlemen.	Good evening, Captain.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.	Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.	Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.	I think perhaps you're right.
You think of everything, don't you?	And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
Have you taken leave of your senses?	I have. Sit down over there.
I have. Sit down over there.	Put that gun down.
I have the letters right here.	Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.	Oh, he won't be followed here.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?	Put it down as a gesture to love.
Oh, no, Rick never --	-- Thanks. I will.
Oh, how do you do?	And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.	The winning side would have paid you much better.
I have my orders.	Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
He is traveling with a lady.	He'll take one.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.	It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
This is the end of the chase.	Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
I stick my neck out for nobody.	A wise foreign policy.
It was a combination of all three.	And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?	My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.	Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.	I was misinformed.
Why? What's in Lisbon?	The clipper to America.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.	Take your hands off me!
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --	-- Sacha, call a cab.
Give me another.	Sacha, she's had enough.
Sacha, she's had enough.	Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
Where were you last night?	That's so long ago, I don't remember.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.	Will I see you tonight?
Will I see you tonight?	I never make plans that far ahead.
Put that phone down!	Get me the Radio Tower!
Get me the Radio Tower!	Put it down!
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?	I haven't the slightest idea.
Make it official, if you like.	What is your nationality?
What is your nationality?	I'm a drunkard.
Rick! Rick, help me!	Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
For how long?	Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.	I don't want them here overnight.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?	Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Where is she? Have you seen her?	No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
What's that you're playing?	Just a little something of my own.
Just a little something of my own.	Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.	No, I don't.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.	If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Well, I ain't sleepy either.	Good. Then have a drink.
Good. Then have a drink.	No. Not me, boss.
No. Not me, boss.	Then don't have a drink.
Then don't have a drink.	Boss, let's get out of here.
Boss, let's get out of here.	No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Shut up and go home, will you?	No, sir. I'm staying right here.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?	Not right now.
I like it fine here.	He'll double what I pay you.
Worse than Warsaw.	Nobody remembers that.
Nobody remembers that.	The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
You can't make it.	Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.	The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.	Die tomorrow or die today.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.	Why do they have to die for me?
You're beautiful.  Marry me.	You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
Fix raft first.	Water water water --
You're putting off the inevitable.	I'm putting it off.
If they can't see you, what's the point?	Survive today, that's the point.
Do too much, I'll die.	Do too little you'll die.
Do too little you'll die.	Going to die anyway.
Can't.  Need water.	You've had today's water.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.	No water, no work.
Feels so good to lie here.	Get up, damn you.
Save some for tomorrow.	Catch another fish tomorrow.
To tell you the truth -- you did.	Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?	No.  that was the last one.
No.  that was the last one.	Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.	Possible.  So you did those wings?
Possible.  So you did those wings?	Yeah.  A long time ago.
Yeah.  A long time ago.	They're harder to do than they look.
They're harder to do than they look.	Oh?  You've tried?
Oh?  You've tried?	Well, I do a little drawing --
You know what happened to this?	As much as anybody.
As much as anybody.	Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.	Okay.  Sure.
Yeah, a long one.	I've got lots of time.
I've got lots of time.	So do I.
What brings you out to the sticks?	Had a package to deliver.
Had a package to deliver.	You?  Personally?
You?  Personally?	I had it on the island with me.
I had it on the island with me.	Must be a story there.
What will you do?	I don't know.  I really don't know.
So simple to say, so hard to do.	Not when you have no choice.
There was a coffin?	Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.	What was inside?
That about sums it up.	Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Her name's Hannah.	Is that Jango?
I got married.	I thought you might have.
I thought you might have.	I would never --
If I'd known you were alive --	I would have done the same thing.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.	A few things came up.  Or went down.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.	A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Get back?  From where?	Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --	I burned the Christmas tree.
That's your dog.	It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.	There isn't any us.
There isn't any us.	Yes there is.
"""We're"" not over-reacting."	Could you watch Jango?
You can't go now.	I have to.
I have to.	You want to.
You know, for when you travel.	For when I travel?
He is a cute thing.	He's your cute thing.
He's your cute thing.	I can't even keep fish alive.

Four four.  A record.	You don't seem too happy about it.
You don't seem too happy about it.	Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.

Merry Christmas eve.	Not if you work for FedEx.
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.	Let's take a look.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?	You smell like formaldehyde.
When's the next Jumbo?	The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.	And how was your Christmas?
And how was your Christmas?	Terrific.  Yours?
If you say you are.	I most definitely say I am.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.	Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.	Which I didn't have.
Thought you were going to bring her.	So did I.
Don't you even think about it.	The place is falling apart.
The place is falling apart.	I'm doing fine.
What happened to your pants?	Mom, meet Jango.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.	Can you find her?
Kamal is not here.	Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?	It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.	What's going on down there?
What's going on down there?	Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.	Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
That's what it's about.	Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
Digital laser readers.	Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
That's all there is.	Believe me I know.
I braided them.	Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.	Time I had lots of.
This stinks really bad.	You should have smelled me.
How about we go somewhere else?	Want to see my raft?
I beat the odds!	You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.	Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
I didn't know we had sailboats.	It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.	For all those vacation days you got coming.
May I ask, where are you bound?	San Francisco.  And you?
San Francisco.  And you?	As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Then I wasn't beautiful.	You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.	It was just the ether, Wilbur...
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!	You weren't dreaming about me.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.	Life is waiting.
Only if you can afford it.	Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.	I doubt it. She's just an...
You cook very well!	And that I can drive a truck!
And that I can drive a truck!	Better than I can!
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!	It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.	He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!	He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.	*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!	I'm *not* a doctor!
I'm *not* a doctor!	I'm sorry, Homer.
What are you going to tell the little ones?	I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.	Shouldn't we tell Homer?
What'd she die of?	She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.	Good night, Daddy.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.	Good night, Daddy.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.	He mentions Homer, too, you know.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.	"Wally said to say, ""Hello."""
Do you think she'll be all right?	She knows how to take care of herself.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.	"""...did."" Well, okay."
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.	What do you want me to *do*?
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?	We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
She won't go to St. Cloud's!	Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.	You don't understand! It's her father...
You don't understand! It's her father...	Mr. Rose *knows*?
Mr. Rose *knows*?	He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.	I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
It will be okay.	*What* will be okay?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.	Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.	Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?	The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.	Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
But you had so much *responsibility*.	I never *asked* for any responsibility.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.	Just a little privacy.
And what did she die of, exactly?	She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?	"""King Kong"". It's really good."
People watched the movies in their cars?	When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?	Yes! I've only seen one, though.
I better go.	I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
So. Not bored yet?	I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.	Yes, I *have*!
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.	*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!	He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
I love you, Wally.	I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
There! You said it was boring.	Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
Wally thinks apples are boring.	I never said they were boring.
I never said they were boring.	"You said, ""Apples aren't exactly flying."""
"You said, ""Apples aren't exactly flying."""	Well, they aren't.
So many children. Are they all orphans?	Well, this *is* an orphanage.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?	Nobody special enough, Curly.
Nobody special enough, Curly.	You mean somebody asked?
You mean somebody asked?	Only the right people can have you, Curly.
I thought they might take me.	They wanted a girl.
They wanted a girl.	Nobody ever wants me!
I just wanted to ask you...	Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?	But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
"""Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."""	Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?	"""...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."""
Her temperature is a hundred and four.	How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
Is *your* father dead?	Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.	*Liver* killed him?
*Liver* killed him?	*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.	But did you know him?
But did you know him?	Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.	Did you know your mother better?
Did you know your mother better?	She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.	What's a nanny do?
What's a nanny do?	She looks after other people's children.
She looks after other people's children.	Did you grow up around here?
Did you grow up around here?	No. She was an immigrant.
No. She was an immigrant.	What's an immigrant?
What's an immigrant?	Someone not from Maine.
Uh... it's the end of October.	Is that soon?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?	Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.	That's why Kong loves her!
Did you bite it?	I don't remember.
I don't remember.	It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.	Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.	No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.	I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
It's almost like flying.	What about the trees?
"""Burma run"" because you fly over Burma..."	*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!	It's all very normal.
I think I'd probably like the apple business.	You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?	No, I'm not. I need a job.
I wonder if you might give me a ride.	Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?	Where are you going?
Where are you going?	We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
What kind of plane are you flying?	A B-24 Liberator.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.	Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
I'm stayin', Homer.	Okay. Then you can be of use.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.	This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.	You still doin' it too fast!
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.	It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...	I don't need your gratitude.
I thought it was my turn.	It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.	"I'm not crazy about the ""Little..."""
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.	Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	You do it then.
Where's the name sheet?	Nobody's named this one yet.
Nobody's named this one yet.	It's my turn!
Christ, it's oil of tansy!	I don't know it.
Yes, for both.	I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
"""One: Please don't smoke in bed."""	We heard that one already, Homer.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?	Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
You're not yet three months, are you?	Not yet. What do you know about it?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.	But you don't look very happy.
You okay, Rose?	I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...	I don't like watching anyone be sick.
Give men that. I know how to do it.	Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Do you like to read?	I can't read. Nobody taught me.
It's just my heart.	What you got a picture of your heart for?
Now, now. He's a good boy.	Shit. We don't know what he is.
Shit. We don't know what he is.	Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
No autonomic effects... that's correct.	When will he be home, Major?
When will he be home, Major?	Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
Don't this place look like home?	It look nicer then home!
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!	We see you next harvest.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?	Mind your own business, Peaches.
They told me I was too old to serve.	They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.	I told him that you all is sick.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.	That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
Where do you think you're going?	You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.	You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.	That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...	What's lucky about that?
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?	He ain't never been outta Maine!
Rose Rose has runned away!	She took off in the night!
She took off in the night!	She took off on the bicycle, man.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.	The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.	Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.	Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.	The standard ten.
The standard ten.	Ten percent. Of how much?
Let's just slow down for a second...	You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
We had to finalize the deal.	Everything looks in order.
Everything looks in order.	This has to happen fast.
This has to happen fast.	I know. It won't go unnoticed.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.	There'll be red flags.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?	What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?	Today? Started off great...
We were back on.	After you cut her loose.
You're a superstitious fucker.	Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
But there were other factors.	Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Keeping the Fix happy.	You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.	It's all about the money, isn't it?
It's all about the money, isn't it?	Isn't it always?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.	Gee... What makes you say that?
Gee... What makes you say that?	Your life flashing before your eyes?
Your life flashing before your eyes?	Just the last three weeks.
Just the last three weeks.	That's not a bad place to start.
And I think it's because of this redhead...	Know who I am, Jake?
Ten is standard, sir.	Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
The red hair... It's bad luck.	It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
Moonan. Here. Shit...	So what? We just stay clear of him.
I'm going home	Let's go, Jake?
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?	What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
You'll be there?	Eight A.M. flight.
She up for this?	She's up for it.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.	"No, not ""whatever."" You're either in or you're out."
How's that? He works for Gillette.	We pay better.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?	Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
You know what we're doing with the money.	And what about Big Al?
I told you, use less powder.	But you won't get that splatter effect.
Come on. Harder.	I think I just broke my hand.
I think I just broke my hand.	Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Come here. Feel this.	No thanks. I'm good.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.	Let me repeat -- Why not?
Let me repeat -- Why not?	Because you killed one of my crew.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?	Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.	Ring it for him, Sobo.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.	Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --	Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
"You tell them the ""Tale""."	What do you want? An apology?
What do you want? An apology?	No, I want my cut!
Sorry. I didn't know...	Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
What about what?	What about the money?
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.	Lily... Jesus Christ...
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.	Don't ruin this for me.
Look at you... You want to go.	For what? A couple hundred bucks?
It's what I do. It's my job.	Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?	Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?	Do you have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?	Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?	No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.	How do you know I will?
You're just going to have to trust me.	I don't trust anyone.
I don't trust anyone.	Then show me how.
What the hell's his problem?	Don't worry about it.
What about Customs?	I'll worry about Customs.
No.  What's my cut?	You get an equal cut.
You get an equal cut.	What do I have to do?
What do I have to do?	Just play a part. A little acting.
That's not --	You interested in a little work?
What is this? You guys cops or something?	We're not cops.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...	Where the hell is she?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...	Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?	We never had a problem with that before.
We never had a problem with that before.	Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
We're working for the King.	Wait a second... Who's the mope?
Stop waving that thing around.	You sure we're clear?
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.	You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.	What was it?
What's up with you? Bladder infection?	Keep it up.
You going to have the time?	I'll find the time.
It's not history.	So what do you want?
Can I speak to you in confidence?	Huh? Oh. She's alright.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.	Confidence. It's just confidence.
Did he buy it?	I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?	Let's just say he burned me once.
What do you get out of it?	Peace of mind.
It's just insurance.	That's what I'm talking about.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.	What are you talking about?
Why did you quit?	I got scared.
I got scared.	I can imagine.
You called the casino a cesspit.	Well it is. But I know where I am.
I hate cheats.	All men are cheats.
My car's in the garage.	Maybe another time.
Maybe another time.	I'll take you up on that.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.	Is it that bad?
Is it that bad?	How do I look?
How about fifteen hundred?	How about five hundred.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.	Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?	I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
What kind of deal you looking to?	What's the Blue Book price?
I get it.	Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
I don't gamble.	Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.	It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
I found her in bed with someone.	Who was he?
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.	South African women are very sporty.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!	I'm working on that soccer story.
I'm working on that soccer story.	Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...	I want a job, Giles.
I want a job, Giles.	All right. As what?
She went back to South Africa.	Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.	We all played the field.
Why did you take the money?	I hate public transport.
I want to buy a car.	How can anyone be that naive?
Here...use a spoon.	Leave me alone, Marion.
Leave me alone, Marion.	You're already alone.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.	There was a message, wasn't there?
There was a message, wasn't there?	It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.	Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?	Nothing about you.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?	Never. Why do you ask?
You were talking in your sleep.	Not talking. Writing.
It's beautiful. Thank you.	I hope it brings you luck.
It's the truth.	Without hope there's no point to anything.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.	What about a drink on the way home?
I'm on at nine.	Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
You're my conscience.	Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
I loved it blond.	It's only hair. I haven't changed.
You're shaking. What is it?	Tension. It'll go.
Tension. It'll go.	Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
What's the time?	I don't know.
Are you trying to read my palm?	You've got such beautiful hands.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.	I love you Jack, you know that.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.	How did you land that?
How did you land that?	It came my way. 450 a week.
You're my prisoner.	I've got something to tell you.
I've got something to tell you.	I want to hear it.
I want to hear it.	I've got a job.
Where did you get it?	I. sold the car.
You really are a beautiful woman.	It's not just inner beauty, is it?
You want me drunk?	I won't be that long.
I couldn't resist them.	You mean I won't resist them.
Yes, I know that.	Don't let yourself down.
Don't let yourself down.	I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
Jani! Where are you?	Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.

How are you?	Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.	Did you solve your problems?
Would you like a drink?	No thank you.
And your hand too.	I took the bandage off yesterday.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.	It's all relative.  I need the money too.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.	Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.	I've still got mine.
How much do you owe?	Let it go.
Let it go.	Did they tell you to sleep with me?

I want you to forget what I said.	Wait a minute...

Next time it'll be my neck.	What about my neck?
But if it does.	You keep the ten thousand pounds.

And I thought you were a bright woman.	Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.	Robbery's not criminal?
I'm in trouble.	What kind of trouble?
What kind of trouble?	I owe a lot of money.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?	You don't like cheats, do you.
How did you hurt your hand?	Just an accident. Nothing.
Just an accident. Nothing.	Turn left ahead.
Toss you for it.	I don't gamble.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.	Near the casino.
Near the casino.	In the casino.
In the casino.	Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.	And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.	Do you believe in astrology?
I've lived there.	Well, thank you anyway.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?	Too much. Eighteen hundred.
What happened to Bella?	I'll tell you later.
Don't worry, I won't report you!	I don't gamble.
Does Bella come here?	That bitch? No.
Who are these guys?	Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.

And the girls?	Just girls. What are you drinking?
Just girls. What are you drinking?	Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.	Good call. Help yourself.
What are you, a cop?	If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.	I'm not going to report it.
She's my baby.	How long have you worked at the casino?
You've done pretty well.	Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
Where do you live, Jack?	Over the river.
Over the river.	Have you got transport?
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.	It was you, you shit.

Thanks for the information.	A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.	She was a real asset. But what could I do?
He's paying out in stacks of 25.	I can see.
Does he win?	He's a good customer.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.	All right, Mr Reynolds.
I just want the job.	Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
You want me to check?	I said good call.
What happens if I want to sneeze?	You won't. Not without permission.
Haven't you forgotten something?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	Wipe your hands.
Where's the magnet?	They've been tested.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.	Give me 365.
We check every four days.	Why four? And not three or five?
Why four? And not three or five?	It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Where did you go to school?	I was at Beadles.
I was at Beadles.	I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
What the hell?	Yoo hoo, bomb...
We've got to disarm the bomb.	Doolittle, are you there?
It didn't go off.	Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
The key, goddamit, the key!	Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!	Where is the key?
Where is the key?	We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Where is it? What did you do with it?	I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
What's he doin'?	I think he's talking to it.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.	What flickering light?
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.	I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.	Right, that checks out here.
Talby, Talby, can you read me?	Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.	Talby, can you read me?
Rechannel all safety relays --	-- open quantum latches --
Quantum is up thirty-five.	I read the same here.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.	Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.	Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Fuck that shit.	Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Check at six minutes.	Arm yourself, bomb.
Energy shielding positive function.	Do you remember the detonation time?
Do you remember the detonation time?	Detonation in twenty minutes.
Detonation in twenty minutes.	Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
I have no proof that it was false data.	You have no proof that it was correct data.
To explode, of course.	And you can only do it once, right?
And you can only do it once, right?	That is correct.
Why don't you have more time?	Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
Well of course I exist.	But how do you know you exist?
But how do you know you exist?	It is intuitively obvious.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?	I am always receptive to suggestions.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?	Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
-- open circuit breakers --	-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- remove thrust drive repellant --	-- automatic channels open --
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.	Ah, negative drop.
Commander Powell would have named it.	Commander Powell is dead.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?	Who cares. Don't bother me.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.	Any of 'em any good?
Any of 'em any good?	Naah. All stable.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.	In a second.
In a second.	Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.	I'll check it.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?	Mafhkin oble groop...
Mafhkin oble groop...	Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Doolittle! Help me.	Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?	Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?	Yes, Talby, what is it?
You know what I think about, Talby?	I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I like it up here.	Must get lonely being up here so much.
I need a diameter approximation.	Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
Men... men... what happened, men?	Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Commander? Are you still there?	Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.	We're running out of time, sir.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.	What's that, sir?
What's that, sir?	Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Yes sir. Negative effect.	What was that, Doolittle?
It didn't work?	That's correct, sir.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.	Well, what you might try is --
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.	But the boss knows I always been loyal.
How come I never hearda you before?	I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.	Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
That's not why we're here.	What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
Man, you got a bad attitude.	I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.	Leave.  Now.
Leave.  Now.	Can I say something in my defense?
Some of us are trying to sleep.	You didn't tell me you lived with her.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.	You know each other?
Do you know why I went after Justine?	She was there...
How're ya doin', Max.	You mean until you showed up?
You mean until you showed up?	You're not still pissed?
But I'm afraid of--	Don't look down.
It's a sweep.  C'mon.	What?  Where're we going?
So Max, what do you do with all your money?	I got overhead...
I don't get involved with guns.	I'll make it worth your while.
I'll make it worth your while.	It's a rule.
I ain't mad at you...	I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Where'd you clip this?	I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.	Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Same old story.  Not interested.	Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
Can you help me get her back?	Look, I'd really like to...
Damn... Are you alright?	They took my daughter.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!	SHHH!  Don't do that!
Sophy?  Are you okay?	Mommy, where are you?
Mommy, where are you?	Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
But why can't we stay here?	Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.	Are we in some kind of trouble?
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.	We're quoting Mom again.
I don't know what to say.	Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.	Somebody's got to.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.	You said you could help.
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.	The other ones?
The other ones?	The other one like you...
The other one like you...	You lost me.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.	You need to get out more.
You need to get out more.	C'mere, I want to show you something.
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.	It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.	We are not fine.
It was open.	You got a lotta nerve.
How do I know you didn't?	So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.	Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Am I s'posed to be grateful?	That would be appropriate, yes.
I won't be staying.	I'm not a half bad cook.
How'd you find me?	Wasn't that hard.
Wasn't that hard.	Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?	Too early to tell.
Lemme get my coat.	The one you're wearing?
Sorry about your window.	Can we go somewhere and talk?
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.	Whoever that is.
Whoever that is.	So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?	No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.	We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
You're a thief?	Girl's gotta make a living.
First time I ever heard that.	I was expecting someone else.
I was expecting someone else.	Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.	You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.	Any idea when she'll be back?
Know where I can find her?	You don't want to.
You don't want to.	But she does work here?
I need to talk to her.	Can't help you.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.	Ladies would be elsewhere.
This is not a place you wanna go.	Let go of my hand.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.	You're also a fool.
You're also a fool.	I think you should go now.
Who is it?	A friend of your fiance's.
A friend of your fiance's.	What do you want?
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.	Got a pencil?
Got a pencil?	Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?	Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.	You and me both.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.	Nothing on Hannah?
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.	Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
And because he's my friend.	Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.	And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
They're prisoners to their genes.	So are dogs.
So are dogs.	They don't have a lot of moving parts.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.	Only one I can think of.
Only one I can think of.	Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
A little what?	You know what I'm saying.
How long you and me known each other?	A long time.
A fog bank.	More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
What guys do.  'Nother order.	You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.	I just don't go in with any expectations.
Can you put that in a bag or something?	You get it when I get her.
Make the call.	She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.	She's got my word.
She's got my word.	She's gonna want to hear for herself.
And she bought that?	I have sincere eyes.
Who are you?	What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
Not right now.	Not right now?  Okay, when?
I actually know how this works.	You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.	I'll bet you can.  Sit.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.	What if he's on the level?
Tell everybody hey.	You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Playing hooky again?	Feel like the dog's dinner.
Feel like the dog's dinner.	Probably a touch of what's going around.
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?	You're the best, Maxie.
Okay, okay, okay--	"Say the words, ""I understand."""
She tells you how I've been--	--a philandering pig.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.	You left out condescending.
You left out condescending.	But there's another side--
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?	I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.	Right, the big one-oh.
Right, the big one-oh.	But I'll take a rain check...
I was on call.	I want you on call here.
You love him?	I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...	No, I mean... you love your son?
No, I mean... you love your son?	More than anything in the world.
More than anything in the world.	And he loves you back, doesn't he?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?	He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.	Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.	My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Pick a song, Hawk.	Got any KISS?
Got any KISS?	You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?	Yeah, a man's drink...

What's it worth to you?	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
...at twenty-thirty hours.	One more time in English.
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.	What's in Sandusky?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?	Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
No... You don't think...?	Nah. Couldn't be.
Now, how are we gonna do this?	Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.	Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
We are not stealing my mom's car.	Damn straight we are.
That's Sherry VanHafton.	I've been in love with her since the second grade.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.	See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.	Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
It's my Bullworker.	Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?	Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
Mom, what're we...?	Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Grounded for the rest of the year?	You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!	Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.	Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.

They suspended me for two days.	Are you okay?
That's alright... I understand.	No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Where are you going?	I'm going home.
That was a compliment.	Will you go with me?
Will you go with me?	Where are we going?
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.	Why is that?
Why is that?	We never would have had this conversation.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.	What makes you think I'm not?
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.	Do you get to meet Ed?
You're such a fuck-ass.	When did you stop taking your medication?
You're my only son...	I know, Dad.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?	You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
Why should we care?	Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Who is Frank?	A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.

People get hurt.	But it was an accident. The house was under construction.

People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.	But you were punished.
But you were punished.	Yes. I went to jail.

Hungry Hungry Hippos.	How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
What else makes you feel regret?	That I did it again.

So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?	I... I was playing with fire.
The good stuff.	Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.	Have you ever made love, Donald?
How many times have you seen Frank?	Four times... so far.

No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!	Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
He said to follow him.	Follow him where?
So, I met a new friend.	Would you like to talk about this friend?
Would you like to talk about this friend?	His name is Frank.
Don't you watch the news?	I don't own a television.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.	Everything is going to be just fine.
What's her name?	You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?	Why would I tell Mom?
Why would I tell Mom?	Because you tell Mom everything.
Because you tell Mom everything.	No I don't.  She worries about you.
No I don't.  She worries about you.	Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Her name is Gretchen.	That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
"It's called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel""."	What does time travel have to do with philosophy?

Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.	Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
If that's what you think is necessary.	But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.	You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?	He was a year ahead of us?
Our son just called me a bitch.	You're not a bitch.

Firefly must be captured at any cost.	That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.	It must be done right away.
It must be done right away.	I can't do it right away.
I don't remember.	Oh -- you mean... worm?
Oh -- you mean... worm?	No, that wasn't it...
No, that wasn't it...	Was it -- swine?
Was it -- swine?	No... it was a seven letter word.
No... it was a seven letter word.	Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.	And Vera niece, too.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?	I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
I hope I'm not interrupting.	Take a seat -- you're next.
Take a seat -- you're next.	Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.	That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?	Why -- why -- of course.
Oh, would you...?	For you, I would do anything...
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!	I didn't come here to be insulted.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?	Well no -- not exactly -- but --
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...	I thought everything was working out fine.
They have noble faces.	I've always thought that myself.
Mr. Merrick, sugar?	Yes please, two.
Yes please, two.	One or two?
You stay with me.	Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.	Well, these things take time.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?	I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
Did it go well, darling?	Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
You won't be long?	I'll join you shortly.
Our man is sick. Come right away.	What is it?
I found it.	Did you see it?
What are you going to do?	I'll show you! I'll show you!
I want my man back.	Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Just a moment, how did you get in here?	Never mind that, I want my man!
You don't own this man!	I want him back!
This man belongs in hospital.	Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.	Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
He fell.  He falls.	He must have taken quite a fall.
Do you think they'll go along with us?	Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?	Yes, I think I can.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?	Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?	Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.	Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?	No, more of an acquaintance.
Good morning, Treves.	Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.	You've acquired a taste for this?
You've acquired a taste for this?	It's quite nutritious, sir.
It's quite nutritious, sir.	Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.	I am very pleased to meet you.
I am very pleased to meet you.	I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
How are you feeling today?	I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?	I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?	I feel much better. Thank you.
I feel much better. Thank you.	Are you comfortable here?
Are you comfortable here?	Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
I don't know what I've got.	Nothing of any importance, eh?
I say Freddie, what are you about?	Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.	What a mess.
How long has this man been here?	Three quarters of an hour.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Have you read it?	No, but I certainly shall.
Oh no, my friend...	Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
I'll have to find some more.	Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.	Thank you... very much.
Thank you... very much.	Where did you get this box?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.	You too, my friend. Goodnight.
No, John, not one that I can see.	Then I shouldn't change anything?
Then I shouldn't change anything?	No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?	Yes, very soon.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!	I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.	Oh no, I couldn't.
Mr. Treves! Treves.	John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Is it the one you wanted?	Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.	Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.	Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
You want a dressing bag, John?	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
The Children. Where are your children	Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.	Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Who are they of?	Oh, our relatives... the children.
Oh, our relatives... the children.	The children! May I see?
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?	I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
You look splendid, John.	Thank you very much.
Good evening. How are you feeling?	Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
My name is...	My... name is...
Yes sir.  What's that?	A dressing bag.
A dressing bag.	Very smart indeed.
Very smart indeed.	Yes. John wants it.
Yes. John wants it.	A dressing bag?
A dressing bag?	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Won't come out, eh?	No, he's very upset about something.
No, he's very upset about something.	Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?	I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?	Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.	I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Are you the proprietor?	And who might you be, sir?
And who might you be, sir?	Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.	I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
It's all right! It isn't happening!	But, Father, it IS!
It's your fantasy...	But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!	You're losing your temper!
Well... where is he?	There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!	There IS no one.
Open up! I know you're in there!	Ah! It's my father!
Ah! It's my father!	Open up! I know you're in there!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.	But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!	There is something I must ask the Gods...
The second note.	The second note to wake the Gods...
Do you believe I love you?	I... but I...
Yes -- I believe you do.	Then let go!
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.	I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
I'll bring it back.	Erik. You don't understand.
Just give me a hand.	I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Five this week; how many the week before?	You're as bad as my father.
You're as bad as my father.	And the week before that?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.	"""The fifth one this week""!"
"""The fifth one this week""!"	Oh, for goodness' sake!
Oh, for goodness' sake!	And I thought you said it was something special...
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?	"What... you mean ""got into bed with"" them?"
It was different...	What was she like?
What was she like?	Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...	But you LOVED her all the same...
But you LOVED her all the same...	We never went to bed together.
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?	I've never LOVED anybody!
I've never LOVED anybody!	I've never been to bed with anybody!
What's the matter?	PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Please! Please! What are those?	What are what?
What are what?	Those things in your hands.
Those things in your hands.	These? What are THESE? They're swords.
"How d'you KNOW we're ""friends""?"	Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
WHAT did you say?	I said welcome.
How do we know this is the way?	We blew the Horn Resounding.
We blew the Horn Resounding.	SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
And will the dead ever return, Freya?	That I cannot tell you.
Is there nothing men can do?	The Gods are asleep, Erik.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.	I will go and wake them up!
What do you see, Erik?	I see the world.
I see the world.	Is it night or day, Erik?
Is it night or day, Erik?	It is day, of course, Freya.
It is day, of course, Freya.	Is it summer or winter, Erik?
"Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the ""Viking""?"	I shouldn't have come.
But it IS! Look!	The important thing is not to panic.
Don't talk nonsense.	He wants to kill US!
He wants to kill US!	Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.	You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.	You've got to let me go!
Well, how d'you think I feel?	The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
We're just not a very musical nation...	No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...	A lot of people like our singing.
A lot of people like our singing.	I'm sure it's lovely.
I'm sure it's lovely.	But you don't want to hear it.
But you don't want to hear it.	No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...	Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.	Well... isn't it great?
Why should you care?	I don't know! I just did!
Is THAT Odin?	You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
You told them I raped you -- why?	I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...	Why should you care?
Why should you care?	Why... should YOU care?
Why... should YOU care?	Tell me your name?
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.	I didn't mean to!
I didn't mean to!	Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
About raping me?	About NOT raping you...
About NOT raping you...	You DON'T like it, do you?
You DON'T like it, do you?	Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!	Well you started it.
Well you started it.	I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.	You don't love ME.
What -- rape?	No. It isn't rape then, is it?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?	Oh, get it over with.
Oh, get it over with.	I don't suppose... no...
It's not magic! It's just a trick!	Don't you FEEL it?
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!	I know. I know.
How deep IS the ocean?	Very deep... usually...
Erik! Row! What are you doing?	It saved my father!
It's Halfdan the Black!	I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
What are you talking about?	Come on, move it!
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.	He was lucky...  Sit there.
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?	Find it... AND cross it!
I... I... KILLED her...	That's my boy!
We're missing all the fun...	What's it all about?
You talking piffle, son?	Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?	Who have you been talking to?
Who have you been talking to?	I met this girl...
I met this girl...	It's always the women that start the trouble.
It's always the women that start the trouble.	She got me thinking...
She got me thinking...	So? What'd you do to her?
I want to die...  No, I don't!	Row! Row! Row!
Look, the sky is blue...	The sun! That's it!
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.	Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
What are YOU doing here?	You may need a real Berserk.
You must help us.	We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Why should WE care?	Because... you're... you're the Gods....
No! Let go, Snorri!	I've got you!
I've got you!	You'll be sucked down too!
Weren't we supposed to?	Oh... I feel a little... oh...
A magic dishcloth.	To the oars!
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!	Well, come on!
Thank you VERY much indeed.	Now stop it!
Now stop it!	It's SO nice to feel wanted.
What's the matter with them?	Just say something cheerful.
Just say something cheerful.	Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
You need to say a bit more than that!	Oh... er... yes...
There is another way.	Who gets killed?
Who gets killed?	Nobody gets killed.
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!	What are you talking about?
Well, what else do we do?	How about making friends?
What do you think?	But how could he know... unless...
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.	What's the matter with Bjorn?
I came to find my grandfather.	I have to go...
She hasn't got any.	She MUST have a knife or something...
I AM one, Dad!	We haven't got a spare place.
Look, I bagged it last week.	It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!	Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.	Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
Hey, you two! What's going on?	I was sitting there.
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.	We'd be the first!
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.	What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
What are you talking about, Erik?	What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
You will wait?	What d'you expect me to do?
It can't do you any HARM...	What do we have to do?
What do we have to do?	Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.	Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.	Same thing, isn't it?
Same thing, isn't it?	No, it is NOT.
Are you all right?	No, I'm not.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?	I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
Let me go, Sven.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	I'm not worth risking your life for.
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?	Get away, Snorri.
Get away, Snorri.	What have you got there?
I should have got rid of you long ago!	Like you got rid of Snorri!
She knows it was our fault!	Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
YOU do it!	You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?	How can we stops him now?
Wasn't it, Keitel?	Well... I... I thought...
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...	The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...	The bottom falls out of the sword business!
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...	Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.	Together we stand!
Together we stand!	You can't let Erik do THAT.
Can't make enough swords!	Can't make enough axe-heads!
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...	"Yes yes... of course.... the ""Blacksmith's Code""..."
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.	You could charge him what you like.
Well, go on! Go berserk!	GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.	I'm just building up to it, Dad.
HOLD it! HOLD it in!	DEATH TO DRAGONS!
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!	Not now, Sven...
Not now, Sven...	I must KILL! Kill!
I must KILL! Kill!	It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
It's a tradition.	I know, Dad.
I know, Dad.	I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...	You went berserk...
So did your father...	So did my father and his father before him.
So did my father and his father before him.	But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility...	But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.	I must only let the red rage...
Thorfinn! You can't die!	I'm not frightened... of anything...
I'm not frightened... of anything...	You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!	No... he's not... not... there...
No... he's not... not... there...	Tell him I'm coming!
Well I'M certainly not, either.	Neither am I.
And keep your sword greased.	Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
Yeah, you told me that later.	I told you that later.
No, it was lovely.	Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
And I just liked you so much.	You did? You liked me?
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
Okay, I guess.	Here we are.
Come up to Boston with me?	Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.	Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
In the room?	In the world.
Come over after I'm done here?	I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
You were not.	I was not.
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
I can't stop thinking about you.	Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.	What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --	I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Says you were a bully...	A bully? Moi?
I don't know.	Doesn't sound like me.
Hey, Joel --	-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.	I'm nervous, too.
I'm nervous, too.	Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.	Well, you obviously don't know me.
Well, you obviously don't know me.	I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
I think I should go back.	Joel, come here. Please.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.	I don't know.
What if you stay this time?	I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.	I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
What are you doing?	It's freezing out here.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.	But my sleeping is really fucked up.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.	I don't think I've slept in a year.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?	I love her.
I think she's great.	Me too. There's this poem --
I think, before.	Seems too coincidental that way.
What do we do?	Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
You know what I did.	Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.	You said --
I remember that speech really well.	I had you pegged, didn't I?
I had you pegged, didn't I?	You had the whole human race pegged.
I'd like to... take you out or something.	Well, you're married.
Well, you're married.	Not yet. Not married.
I told her today I need to end it.	Is that what you want?
Is that what you want?	I did it. I guess that means something.
I dropped you off after. You said --	Come up and see me... now.
Come up and see me... now.	It's very late.
It's very late.	Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.	And I didn't have an argument.
Right. Something black though.	I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.	We did talk about Naomi.
We did talk about Naomi.	I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.	I'm sure, I said.
I'm sure, I said.	But you weren't. I could tell.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.	"This is our first ""date"" date."
"This is our first ""date"" date."	Do you remember what we talked about?
Do you remember what we talked about?	Naomi, I guess.
I scoured the city for it.	I love it!
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.	Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.	Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
What if you hide me?	What do you mean?
Such a beautiful view.	Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?	I don't know.
No, it isn't that.	I want to know you.
I want to know you.	I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.	Joel, you're a liar.
So, um --	Would you get me another, Joely?
I don't want to talk about this here.	Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?	I want to have a baby.
I want to have a baby.	Let's talk about it later.
I don't think we're ready.	You're not ready.
How can you watch this crap?	Where are you going?
Where are you going?	I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
Let me drive you home.	Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.	You'll call me, right?
Sounds good. But right now I should go.	You should stay.
Well, I should probably get going.	No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?	No. I --
No. I --	I know a man who needs a refill.
What do you want to hear?	You pick it.
You pick it.	You just say. I'm not really --
Ready for another?	No, I'm okay for now.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.	Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?	I don't know.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.	Well, I wouldn't want to be --
So you like bookstores, huh?	I like to read.
I like to read.	Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Where do you live?	You're not a stalker or anything, right?
You're not a stalker or anything, right?	Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
I'm not a stalker.	You know Wilmont?
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.	No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.	You're sure? It's cold.
You're sure? It's cold.	I don't want to take you out of your way.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.	Probably see you at the book store.
Probably see you at the book store.	Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
I don't know what that means.	Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?	I'm not nuts.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.	Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Really? Because --	Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I don't have one.	I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
I like it.	Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.	Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --	Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?	I can't remember.
I don't really know how --	Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.	Yeah, I got it.
Hi, it's Joel.	Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.	You must have been crazy.
You must have been crazy.	Guess what I'm wearing.
Guess what I'm wearing.	I don't know. Panties and --
I don't know. Panties and --	Your dried cum.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?	I probably got the same thing as you.
What took you so long?	I just walked in.
I just walked in.	Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Hmmm. Do you miss me?	Oddly enough, I do.
I guess so.	Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
I just got in.	Long day thinking.
I should maybe talk to you.	Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.	I'm like a joke to them.
You have to stop this!	What? What do you mean?
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.	I had a good time last night. I really did.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --	I'm glad you called.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!	I hope you get your work done.
So you don't mind?	I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.	In a minute.
How was it?	You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.	Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.	Go back to sleep.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.	No. I just need some space, maybe.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?	Nah, I don't know.
Oh, hey, Patrick.	Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!	Mary... please. This is hurting people.
I know what it is.	Then why did you ask me?
What do you want, Stan?	Can I... I brought some --
How did I look?	Happy. Happy with a secret.
Well, what should we do?	I don't know! I just said that!
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.	That's a good one.
It's freezing out.	You found us okay?
You found us okay?	Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?	We haven't checked.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --	I better do this, Stan.
Sorry. I just --	It's just... y'know... I mean...
It's just... y'know... I mean...	I know. Anyway --
I know. Anyway --	Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
I have a family, Mary.	You made me have an abortion.
You made me have an abortion.	It was a mutual decision.
We can't do this.	No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
It's no big deal.	You are such a sweetheart.
Do you like quotes, Howard?	How do you mean?
Order me a pastrami for after?	Cole slaw, ice tea?
Howard, your one o'clock.	Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Well, where was Patrick?	He went home sick.
He went home sick.	Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.	1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
So, I've got to drop the van off.	Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.	That's fine, Stan.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.	Yeah, probably a good idea.
I tried that already.	Did you try going through C-Gate?
Did you try going through C-Gate?	Yeah. Of course.
Mary. What are you doing here?	She came to help, Howard.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.	Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --	She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
What's your bartlett's?	It's a quote book.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.	Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.	Okay, There's more, Stan --
You can if you want.	Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?	This one's history. Moving on...
Does that help?	Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
The voltage looks fine.	Then check the connections.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.	You mean she's dead?
What do you believe in then?	Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
But I don't know how to polka.	Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.	I know who you are.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?	I'm staying with the Countess.
No, I guess not.	'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.	Whose fault was that?
What are you doing?	Getting dressed. I've got to go.
I have to go, Julian.	Why? Why do you have to go?
Are you in show business?	I was a successful model once.
I'm the best.	You're the best?
...do you copy?	Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.	Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
I can see why they sent you along.	So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
That means top-secret, Cooper.	I heard it.
Will it work?	It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.	On my way.
We have a man down...	Coop, where are you...
Coop, where are you...	The containment, Second Containment...
The containment, Second Containment...	Hold on, Coop...
Time to play Spam in the can.	Don't start with me, Cooper.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...	Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
I don't know what happened to Justin.	I'm telling you, I saw it...
No, he didn't.	You weren't there. I saw it.
How? The Bridge is gone.	There must be a way! What about Engineering?
There must be a way! What about Engineering?	Can you shut it down?
Can you shut it down?	I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
Let me breathe, let me breathe...	You're okay now, it's over...
Is that an offer?	It is not.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.	It gets worse.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.	We'll make it.
Does he know that?	What's on your mind?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.	Some things you don't get over.
"""The dark inside...""? I don't understand."	From the Other Place...
What, Justin, what shows you?	It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...	That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.	I'm going in.
How do you know all this?	I built it.
Justin, finish your sweep.	Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.	Start the countdown.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...	...how's the client?
Okay. I'm on the bridge.	What you got, Peters?
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...	There's no one here, Skipper.
I can see the hatch.	Starck, you still showing those readings?
That means they didn't abandon ship.	So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
Jesus its huge.	Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
We've got pressure.	Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
I'm not the Devil.	Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Then what, what are you? Tell me...	Better if I just show you.
Weir is dead.	Then who the fuck are you?
Then who the fuck are you?	Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
I told you... She won't let you leave...	Son of a bitch!
What do you want me to say?	You said this ship creates a gateway...
I don't know...	Where has it been for the past seven years?
Where has it been for the past seven years?	I don't know...
I don't know...	"The ""Other Place,"" what is that...?"
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?	I don't know.
What about it?	The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
If it worked.	If it worked, yes.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.	Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
What does it say?	NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
Where has it been for the last seven years?	That's what we're here to find out.
Where is it, where is it...	Smith? Smith! Fuck!
No, no, we just got her back together...	Get out of there now!
Smith, get out of there...	Come again, Skipper?
Captain Miller, you copy?	I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Do we have enough time for a weld?	We don't have time to fart.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!	We have a situation here...
It is now.  We're locked in.	Starck, give me a read.
1500 meters. We're getting too close...	Where is it?
We've got some weather.	I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...	...repeat, we're armed...
...repeat, we're armed...	Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
I'll do it --	No. I'll be right back.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.	Blow it up?
Weir can't be alive.	Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
Miller, come in...	What's going on in there, Starck?
What's going on in there, Starck?	Justin's in the airlock.
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.	Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...	Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.	I know that.
You've got to listen...	To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Maybe one of the original crew?	No. It was someone else.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.	Do it. Dr. Weir...
How much oh-two do we have?	Oxygen is not the problem.
It tastes bad.	But you can breathe it.
We're all here.	Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
That's an affirmative.	Keep your eyes open.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.	Come around to three-three-four...
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?	I just finished drying...
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.	Can you see a body?
Can you see a body?	There's no one here.
Here's another one. They're all over the place.	They're explosive charges.
He's been past Mars?	He served on the Goliath.
He served on the Goliath.	Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Almost got it.	Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.	Keep him talking.
Keep him talking.	Do you know what it was?
He's engaged the override.	Can you shut it down?
There's no one in the corridor but us.	Not according to the computer.
The safety circuit's failed!	We're losing atmosphere...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...	She's not ugly.
Where is she?	Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
Miller, do you read me, Peters --	Get them back --
Get them back --	I'm trying, goddammit --
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...	Picking up magnetic interference.
If they are, they're screening their calls.	Range 3000 meters and closing.
You can't do that.	The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
30 hours to Neptune orbit.	All boards are green, everything's five by five.
What is it?	The forward airlock.
The forward airlock.	Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.	I'm alright. Please.
What are you doing?	It wants me. I have to go.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.	Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
A straight line.	Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
We're going to have to work on your touch.	I like the sound of that.
I'm not really dressed for a party.	Relax, it's casual.
Relax, it's casual.	No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
How'd you know it was me?	I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I don't think She's real big on hate.	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Where is Reed?	Victor must've taken him.
Oh, he did.	What did he do to the uniform?!
You look like an eighties rock band.	The suit will stretch. You should try it --
The suit will stretch. You should try it --	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Ben, come in.	What is this? Where's Reed?
What is this? Where's Reed?	Where do you think? With Sue.
What are you doing here?	I'm worried about you.
I'm worried about you.	About me? How sweet.
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it. Everything I want.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?	Deb, it's me. It's still me.
We're working as hard as we can --	Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.	Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --	O-kay. We'll skip that question.
We had a tough year.	Yeah, nine years straight.
What the --!	Ben. Are you okay?
Ben. Are you okay?	Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Are you alright?	I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?	He's smart, powerful, successful --
He's smart, powerful, successful --	Well maybe you should date him.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --	Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.	I should have done more, run more tests --
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.	Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Isn't that your speech?	He's made a few changes.
I had it at four.	This makes five.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.	I'm sure he's matured since then.
What about his first born?	Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
I can't take this.	Ben. This is business. Just work.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.	You'd never know it.
Hey! That's a prototype!	Go back to the drawing board.
Where... where am I?	Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
'Course not. Strictly business.	Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.	Don't you wander off, boy.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.	Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...	That's terrible news...
You're on fire!	Not this again --
Not this again --	No: You're ON FIRE!
Stay right. Left is trouble.	I though we went over this.
I though we went over this.	Last one down springs for room service.
So are you!	I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Back it down, Johnny!	I can go hotter!
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.	Oh, it is.
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!	Ben, are you there?
Now what is up with that?	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.	Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
What are you doing --	Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.	But Johnny... you can't fly.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --	No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
You two need a time-out.	Blockhead started it!
What is that thing?	I think that thing is Ben.
Apparently I can disappear.	Please tell me you go silent too.
"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."	And that's a good thing?
Leonard, how's the feed?	Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
I found a broken gasket, from space --	A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --	I'm sure I can come up with something.
I can... make it work.	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Reed. How close are we to a cure?	No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?	Of course. Of course.
And reverse the mutations --	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
I mean, you broke up with me, right?	Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?	No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
That's what we're here to find out.	If it happened to him, then it could...
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.	What...?  Oh.
Uh, Sue...? I can't.	What? What do you mean you --
What? What do you mean you --	Sue... look at your hands.
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?	Ben did this.
Ben did this.	Ben did this?
Come on, Ben, come on...	Reed, we're running out of time.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?	Not at all.
Please don't make this personal --	Oh, I think you already have.
Oh, I think you already have.	Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
Victor, your scar --	I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.	I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, I'm sorry I --	Just find him.
What's going on?	Victor, are you feeling alright?
What are you doing?	Raising the shields.
Raising the shields.	You can't leave them out there.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?	I understand the business reasons.
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?	Arnold. What's happening?
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.	Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
How much did they cost?	Don't worry about it.
I can't find it, mon!	It's the first door on your left!
It's the first door on your left!	On the ledge?
On the ledge?	First door on your left!
First door on your left!	There it is!
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?	This is how I dress all the time.
This is how I dress all the time.	But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?	Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.	See you later.
See you later.	Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
Does Mom know you have company?	It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Are you still a virgin?	Maybe yes. Maybe no.
I don't know. I was just curious.	Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.	You are a virgin!
You are a virgin!	I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.	But your face did!
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?	Where did you hear that?
Where did you hear that?	I'm just guessing.
I'm just guessing.	Well... it's true.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.	Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?	They're not home yet.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?	I'll explain everything later.
Mom says to clean up the pool.	Why can't you do it?
Why can't you do it?	Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.	Your friends use the pool too.
Your friends use the pool too.	I take out the garbage.
I take out the garbage.	Don't strain yourself.
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?	They were left over from the last shift.
They were left over from the last shift.	Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.	But they weren't mine.
Leave me alone!	Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!	Leave me alone.
We've got to get an abortion?	Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Take that back.	All right, I take it back.
Why don't you call me up tonight?	Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
I didn't see you this morning.	Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?	I guess I did.
What? Are you all right?	I think we're making a lot of noise.
I think we're making a lot of noise.	I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
You're a really good kisser.	So are you.  Are you shaking?
So are you.  Are you shaking?	No. Are you crazy?
Pick a suit.	I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Do you have any ice tea?	Sure. Come on in.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?	Mark is a really nice boy...
Nice to meet you, Stacy.	Nice to meet you.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?	Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
You're losing it, Damone.	You're crazy. Those girls love me.
No Damone. I don't understand.	She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Well, I've gotta be running.	Okay. See ya.
Hey, Mark. Is that you?	Damone! You come here?
Damone, are you there?	I'm really pretty busy...
Damone. It's Mark.	Mark. What happened to your date?
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?	All right. Pay attention.
All right... where did you see her?	She's in my biology class.
She's in my biology class.	Did you get her number?
Did you get her name?	No. It's too soon.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?	Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
It's definitely your mama.	Damone, you gotta listen to me.
And they don't call my parents?	Not if you're over sixteen.
Not if you're over sixteen.	Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.	And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
How often do you go?	I don't go at all.
How've you been?	Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
That's him! He did it!	Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
Just be glad you're all right.	My brother is gonna shit.
My brother's car!	All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!	They're fuckin' with us.
What the fuck is this guy doing?	This ain't no cop.
Seen the new Playboy?	Naw. Any good?
Naw. Any good?	Suzanne Somers' tits.
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.	I thought he was out of town.
He's not coming.	Not coming? What happened?
Yeah, like maybe never.	But what are you going to do?
But what are you going to do?	Well I might go to Dartmouth.
What do you want?	I want romance.
I want romance.	Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
That little prick.	I paid for it and everything.
What do you think it is?	What do you think it is?
What do you think it is?	It couldn't be.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.	I don't know... I just don't feel right.
God, he hardly even talks anymore.	I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
What do you think?	I think they're both virgins.
How long does Doug take?	I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.	What's Doug do in Chicago?
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...	Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?	You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Does that ever happen?	No. But it's a nice idea.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.	I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.	Not since November.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.	Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Was it great?	It was okay.
It was okay.	You'll always remember your first time.
You'll always remember your first time.	It was nice.
It was nice.	So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?	Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.	Hey! That's my line!
Just kidding. About 10cc.	Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.	What's the big deal?
What's the big deal?	Well I never did it.
Well I never did it.	There's nothing to it.
No way! He just called him a dick.	God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'	Should we buy a frame for that?
Don't you like him?	Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.	Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.	What should I do?
How's it going.	Do you think that guy's cute?
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.	All right! Oh, yeah!
I think I've made my point with you tonight.	Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
If you graduate.	You're gonna flunk me?!
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?	I don't know. I guess so.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.	Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
Mr... Mr. Hand.	That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?	I couldn't make it in time.
I couldn't make it in time.	You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?	I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
I think I better take you home.	What about those other guys you live with?
What about those other guys you live with?	No. I mean back to your home.
Are you really nineteen?	Yes... I am really nineteen.
That's a nice shirt.	Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Thanks. So do you.	Where do you feel like going?
Where do you feel like going?	I don't know. Wherever you want.
I don't know. Wherever you want.	How about the point?
How about the point?	The point sounds fine.
The point sounds fine.	All right, the point it is.
What can I get for you tonight.	How about your phone number?
You look like you could still be in high school.	I know, everyone says that.
What about the notes?	I'll get you the notes.
What's April 16th?	It's John Bonham's birthday.
...I've got to go home.	Do you really have to go?
Do you really have to go?	Well... it's getting kind of late.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.	Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Where's your brother?	I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?	No. That's okay.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.	Do you want to come inside?
Do you want to come inside?	Aren't your parents asleep?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.	Two more Cokes.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?	Not at all.
Do you know what you want?	I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?	Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. She is pretty good.	Yeah. She is pretty good.
This is a nice car.	Yeah. It's my sister's.
What's your other question?	My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?	We keep them.
We keep them.	You keep them.
You keep them.	We keep them, in case the people come back.
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!	Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?	Tell me. What do you want?
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.	Well, thank you.
There's no hurry! The race is over!	Not for me.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?	Awake? What do you mean?
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.	Dobermans don't talk.
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!	Not where we operate.
Naw! Not a major.	He wanted the pineal gland.
Oh, my God!...	This is my granddaughter...
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.	That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
The airport is over there!	Never missed a plane yet.
Some of what?	Extract of pineal!
Where'd you get this?	Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Lucy is looking for you.	No, she's looking for you.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.	They were all veterans.
Like big lizards.	...and every one of them stacked naked...
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.	Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!	Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.	This is a fucking nightmare.
I want that fucking radio!	Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.	You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
When does this thing stop?	It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
That's what gives me The Fear.	Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Not much. Why?	I have to go.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.	Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.	Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Where's the medicine?	The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
What made you do it? Who paid you off?	Nobody. I'm the maid!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...	YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Could I have that, please?	Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
May I see your license.	Of course, officer.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!	You and a lot of other people.
In that case, maybe she can help.	Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!	They'll get in! We'll all die!
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.	Where is everyone?
Where are you two going?	We're going to get my little girl.
You know where it is?	Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
I will not die because of him!	Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
I don't think you should...	With what just happened upstairs --
Well, it don't look pretty.	But it's got teeth.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?	Nah, I got the gun.
We shot a skunk.	We're lucky to be alive.
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.	Gonna stay for a couple?
We'll be food, dickheads!	"Well, your last words can be ""I told you so."""
"Well, your last words can be ""I told you so."""	You gotta be with me on this.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.	Come on, come on.
Where's the tunnel?	In the corner, behind the curtain.
And that's how I ended up here.	And the head?
And the rest of 'em?	Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?	Just an observation.
Just an observation.	Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Fuck you too.	Get in line!
We're better off.	Who's with me?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?	You weren't helpin'.
So, what now? Did those things leave?	Why don't you go check it out?
Your parents of relation?	We lived near power lines.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.	Just cover me. It was built to move.
What's in the back?	Nothing, this was my last delivery.
We're going to get help.	We gotta try.
How much you got?	How much I got, what?
Doesn't your foot hurt?	I can't feel a thing, Hon.
What is this?	Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.	Will I go crazy or something?
In the kitchen, under the sink.	No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.	Oh? And what's that?
Oh? And what's that?	Sit still, look less like a meal.
Sit still, look less like a meal.	I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?	Get outta here.
They were all over the place.	You smell like ass!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!	If he doesn't shut up...
Gimme the keys.	NO, but I will lock you in.
Am I too heavy for you?	Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.	Amazing you made it this far.
Yeah, I'll go.	Ok. Let's see what happens.
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?	Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Let's wait it out.	They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Okay, well that's something.	So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.	And the last one is the...
And the last one is the...	Father. The biggest, the strongest...
Did we make it?	I think --
We should stick together out there.	I'd love to.
You know you don't have to do this.	I'm fine, I really am.
I'm fine, I really am.	I admire your strength.
I admire your strength.	We all have to be strong, right?
Oh my God... What is that?	That's one piece of four problems.
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?	I just hit it like you said.
What did we say about lying?	I'm not lying.
I'm not lying.	You know that no one likes a liar, right?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?	I said I'm not lying.
Frances?  Oh no.	Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?	What're you doing?
What're you doing?	Putting on my armor.
'Forgive'...? For What?	I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
Well... come on.	This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...	Excuse me, sir?
I guess so, sir.	Very fine bone structure.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.	No, I'm concerned with everything.
No, I'm concerned with everything.	But I'm the one up there on the screen.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.	You see: We've got to change that name.
Hi Frances, got a minute?	Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
A rich actress.	Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
I know, but --	What does Clifford say?
What does Clifford say?	Right now we have to be practical.
Hey, where's the fire, sister?	In my eyes, officer.
We're all square now, Harry. Right?	All square, Doc.
All square, Doc.	Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
We'll get you home, Frances.	Thank you, Harry.
Are you... are you hungry?	I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.	I love you too, Francie.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.	Be careful, Francie.
What do I do, Dad?	You really want to go?
And you think it's worth all this?	If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.	I didn't have much to do with it.
I didn't have much to do with it.	You wrote it, didn't you?
You wrote it, didn't you?	Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?	Why, you... you little bastard!
Aren't you ever going back?	...Not if I can help it.
...Not if I can help it.	Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
You can always come see it in London.	Only if you were in it. Are you?
Only if you were in it. Are you?	I wouldn't miss it.
I wouldn't miss it.	Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.	Are you an actor?
You sound as if you hate it.	No, I don't hate it.
That would be okay.	Just a little way.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?	Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?	Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.	How did I look?
How did I look?	Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.	Well... you're looking well.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.	Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
I love you, Harry. I love you.	I love you too, Frances.
Frances, it's me, Harry?	...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
Anyway... if you need me...	I got your number, Mister Man.
You give up on her?	Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.	Frances, You're crazy.
Frances, You're crazy.	I know. Don't tell anyone.
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...	Whattaya think you're in now?
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.	Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
Oh my God, I look awful.	You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Take a walk, pal.	Who said I was a lady?
Nice joint. Can you afford it?	Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
How the hell do you find me anyway?	Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?	What's left of my blood.
What's left of my blood.	Think I'll have a glass.
Think I'll have a glass.	Help yourself. Everyone else has.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!	Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Don't start, Farmer.	It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.	The chauffeur. He's watching.
The chauffeur. He's watching.	He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.	I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
The hell you will, Harry York.	Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
Shit. I meant the other way around.	Well, the studio told me not to.
Well, the studio told me not to.	Is that why you did it?
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.	I know what ability you're interested in.
Harry... I met someone.	Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
How ya doin', Farmer?	Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?	Came to get a tan.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...	You don't know what you want.
What happened to him?	He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.	Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?	You think I'd miss it?
You think I'd miss it?	Well? What'd you think?
Well? What'd you think?	I just wanted to see how you looked.
I just wanted to see how you looked.	How'd I look?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!	Yeah, well --
Yeah, well --	You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Don't touch me.	I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
What'd you do?	You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
Where you goin'?	Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.	Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?	Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...	And no people.
...Is that not true?	Who's writing this guy's lines?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.	Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?	I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?	Did you expect him to look you up?
How's it sound?	The speech? Real good.
The speech? Real good.	You think I got it?
You think I got it?	You got it.
You got it.	Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
'But how do I know you love me?'	Your big speech?
But I want to. I'm trying!	I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.	No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Where are you going?	I'm going out!
I'm going out!	You're not going anywhere!
Say you promise.	I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
I'll have lunch ready by one.	I'll be back.
I'll be back.	At one. Promise?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.	Where are you going?
Where are you going?	For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Well, who have we here...?	Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...	Why are these all opened?
Then why did you bring them?	It's your fan mail, little sister.
It's your fan mail, little sister.	You kill me, Mama.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!	Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Don't I know you?	I don't believe so.
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.	Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.	Oh for Christ's...
Yes. It was very good to see her.	Really? Any problems?
Is there something else?	You didn't say 'Symington says'.
...Did you really say that?	Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.	This whole thing is a joke!
This whole thing is a joke!	Stay calm, please.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?	Thanks are hardly necessary.
Thanks are hardly necessary.	Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
It ain't for lack of trying.	So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?	Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
What is that to you? Evil as you are.	I am as he made me. In his own image.
I am as he made me. In his own image.	You drove him to his torment.
You drove him to his torment.	And he drove me to mine.
And he drove me to mine.	Then why weep for him?
People can be kinder than you think.	I am afraid.
You're an outcast.	Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.	Friends? Do they live around here?
Friends? Do they live around here?	Yes. Very close
Yes. Very close	Why do you not go to them?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.	It can't be as bad as that.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!	SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
You will honor your promise to me!	I will not! Kill me now!
What is this?	A brain. Extremities.
A brain. Extremities.	This was not taken from a grave.
This was not taken from a grave.	What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.	No. I draw the line.
Yes. I want this over and done with.	I'll be waiting. And watching.
What can I do?	There is something I want.  A friend.
I don't know.	Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
Kill me and have done with it.	Kill you? Hardly that.
Your crime... as well as mine.	How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.	Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?	I see it before me.
Nothing. Still nothing.	It's been months. It's not like him.
So have I	I should go. I should leave today.
You dance so beautifully together.	And you look so lovely.
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!	Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?	One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
Poor William! What indignant tears!	There, there... shhh...
Have you seen Willie?	Is he not back yet?
Brother and sister no more.	Now husband and wife.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.	Why the change? What about your work?
Why the change? What about your work?	It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.	Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!	I do. But you must trust me for now.
What sort of task?	It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
I thought I'd never see you again!	I'm all right. I'm safe,
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?	I've no choice
Our decision. Together.	Your decision. For us.
Your decision. For us.	I give you my soul...
I give you my soul...	...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.	Victor. I love you,
Victor. I love you,	Elizabeth. My more than sister.
You make me weak.	Not as weak as I.
Brother and sister still?	I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your husband.	I wish to be your wife.
I wish to be your wife.	Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
This feels... incestuous.	Is that what makes it so delicious?
I've loved you all my life	All my life I've known.
Smell the air. Wonderful.	Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Quite a send-off, isn't it?	Father's so proud.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.	I'll have to do better than that.
I'll have to do better than that.	You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!	The world is a dizzying place.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?	Nothing can. Not ever.
A warming wind.	This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
It's going to ram us.	It wouldn't dare.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?	No. But someday.
No. But someday.	Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.	I owe you that. Done.
What happened up there?	I didn't find what I was looking for.
Quite a place.	Thank you, Henry.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.	Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
How much longer?	Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
You're making a scene!	Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!	You can't. Death is God's will!
You can't. Death is God's will!	I resent God's monopoly.
They'll hang him all the same.	Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.	Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
Only you would think of that!	Somebody has to!
You're a comfort to me, Henry.	What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.	It's a letter to my father.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?	Can you think of a better reason?
Can you think of a better reason?	Quite a few.
Quite a few.	Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.	I know. You have a way of making an impression.
Are you having me on?	Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
I am not mad.	As a march hare.
I was just clearing my throat.	Very well then.
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.	Despite the lack of challenge.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...	What is your name?
What is your name?	Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.	The strain was evident.
Re-configure the leads?	Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.	Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
Victor, explain yourself.	Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Who are you?	My name is Frankenstein...
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.	Are you a physician?
Are you a physician?	How is it you come to be here?
Creature? A... human like creature?	You know of it?
You know of it?	Your men are right to be afraid.
We should go now.	Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
The killer is still out there.	I will protect you.
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.	Jack? Marcie? Ned?
Good night, Alice.	Good night, Brenda.
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.	Tomorrow is another day.
What'd you see?	I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Any particular reason?	Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.	You want to leave?
You want to leave?	I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
What's the matter with it?	Wet. I don't know.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.	Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Do you have a dime? A quarter?	No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
I don't hear it anymore.	Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.	It sounded like Brenda.
It sounded like Brenda.	I'll go take a look.
I'll go take a look.	Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.	Not if they're where I think they are.
How the... did he get in there?	Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
What'll you do when you leave here?	I don't know.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.	I finished the boats.
Somebody's there, Barry.	Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.	Let's go back, Barry...
Let's go back, Barry...	I need you so much, Claudette.
You know what I said, though.	I can't, Barry...
You said we were special.	I meant everything.
Chance to get even?	I'll spot you five points.
Roll him over!	Get behind him more.
What is it?	Is it stuck?
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.	A short somewhere.
You saved my life.	I had to.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...	Don't get up. Take a second...
What the hell?	Where'd you get that stuff?
What hath God wrought?	That was the telephone.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?	I don't believe you...
I don't believe you...	Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Are you wet?	Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?	Lead the way!
It's just a dream.	I call it my shower dream.
What about Neddy?	I don't love Neddy.
I don't love Neddy.	He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.	Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.	I love you.
I love you.	I love you.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?	Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.	There you are dead wrong.
That's thirty percent.	For two lonely nights.
How much do I owe you?	One night on the town.
Anything else you want?	No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
What was that?	Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.	You said it was just you and your son.
You said it was just you and your son.	I meant me, my son and my daughter.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.	Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
How many with you?	Just my son and I.
Just my son and I.	What is your purpose in Mexico?
What is your purpose in Mexico?	Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
You like the car?	I said new, this is an '90.
So do I just follow you?	Yeah, follow us.
Yeah, follow us.	So let's do it.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.	Have you ever been there before?
You don't believe in suicide.	It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
What are you gonna do?	I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.	No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
What's this guy's problem?	I have no idea.
In the Winnebago.	In other words, no.
Why not, against your religion?	No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.	Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
You're a preacher?	I was a minister.
I was a minister.	Was? As in not anymore?
How do I know you'll keep your word?	Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Didn't like it, did ya?	No, I didn't.
You won't let him touch her?	I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Yes, she is.	How'd she die?
Sorry, I need everybody.	My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Where are the keys to the motor home?	On the dresser.
He's my son.	How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.	Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.	Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.	What's this about, money?
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!	Not good enough, swear to God.
There's nothing wrong with this place.	It's a flop house.
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.	That happens, you'll get it back.
What do you think Mom would say?	Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
What you said to me in the room.	What did I say?
What did I say?	You asked me if I would --
What's going on?	We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.

Were you giving that pig signals?	What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
You can't come in here.	What dya mean?

They broke when you fell.	Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!	Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?	I don't know, you just passed out.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?	This ain't the time.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.	No, I didn't.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.	You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
This isn't gonna work.	Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
Seth, if you were me --	Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.	Yes, Seth, I understand.
Is it me? Is it my fault?	It's not your fault, it's her fault!
She's in the other room.	What the fuck is she doin' there?!
All I'm saying --	-- This conversation is over.
How's it feel?	How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.	He didn't recognize shit.
Start the car.	You believe me don't cha?
You believe me don't cha?	Shut up and start the car.
What the fuck was that about?	He signaled the Ranger.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.	Don't say my name.
Don't say my name.	Who's...  Lieuten --
I've been accused of that wish.	The woman I saw you with...
The woman I saw you with...	Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.	But are there... I mean, how many...

That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.	I believe it.
I believe it.	I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Wait. How about this?	Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
Martin, look at me.	I'm looking at you.
What happened? The pressure got to you?	Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.	No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.	So you want to know.
So you want to know.	If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.	I'm thinking of a movie.
I'm thinking of a movie.	One of mine?
One of mine?	One we're producing.
One we're producing.	With what? Wiseguy money?
Yeah. That was a good party.	You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
How? By taking my money?	You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.	It's all mine.
It's all mine.	Sit down, Leo.
You've been losing.	I'm up twelve grand today.
I'm up twelve grand today.	From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?	Who told you that?
How'd you know I was here?	Here's another tip...
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?	They report it to the IRS.
What took you so long?	Couldn't find my toothbrush.
I'll be right back.	Go get your stuff.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.	Are you going down?
Are you going down?	I don't know.
I don't know.	You're as bad as Harry...
You're as bad as Harry...	I'll go. I'll go.
You thought I was faking?	No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?	I want to know.
I want to know.	Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Why does anyone want to be in movies?	Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
I think it's not horrible.	I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.	Then you've read it?
You been here the whole time?	I just caught the end.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?	I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?	What're you doing here?
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.	...That's what we finally decided.
The door from the patio, in back.	You broke in?
You broke in?	No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.	What if it was?
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.	No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?	He already knew it.
He already knew it.	Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.	Whatta you doing out there?
Whatta you doing out there?	I'm going into the movie business.
I'm going into the movie business.	What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?	I'm thinking about producing.
I told you not to -	Don't say a fuckin' word.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?	That's what the guy said.
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?	Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.	What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?	Pick 'n' Save.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.	You seem to feel fine about it.
You seem to feel fine about it.	I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.	Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.	No problem. You go on off to bed.
I don't have a dog.	You don't? What happened to Muff?
You don't? What happened to Muff?	Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Be quiet and listen.	I don't hear anything.
Lufkin. His... agent.	Yeah, Karen knows him.
Yeah, Karen knows him.	But you are interested?
A passenger liner, north island. Over.	What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?	A passenger liner. Over.
A passenger liner. Over.	Say again. Over.
The turbine blew.	Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
What day is it?	I don't know. Tuesday?
I don't know. Tuesday?	Wrong. It's Friday.
What's so great about Sweden?	It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.	Damn mind of it's own.
What? You sure?	That's what it says.
You think the extra strain caused it?	Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.	With that coxswain dickhead.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.	I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.	Maybe he isn't alone.
Maybe that is his boat.	Gimme a break.
Guess I'll just keep working.	What're you crazy?
What're you crazy?	I like my job.
This's gonna hurt a little.	Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
Last thing we want is extra partners.	Or uninvited guests.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.	Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.	Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.	If money can buy what he wants.
If money can buy what he wants.	I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.	Then you're a lucky man.
Conveniently enough for you.	Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!	You smashed it!
Don't lie to me!	What the fuck -- ?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!	I don't know what you're talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about?	I think you know.
I think you know.	Maybe you can tell me then.
On a passenger ship in 1953?	If they knew what they were carrying.
What is it?	I think you better see this for yourself.
That'd be my guess.	So whoever did this might still be around.
Damn barbaric is what it is.	Could be meant as a warning.
Bodies're too fresh.	Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Sounds like the hull.	Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.	It looks like it.
Or somebody stopped them.	Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
It's a hell of a lot of money.	What, you think there's something funny about it?
Turbine rotor's shot.	I thought you said it was just a blade.
I thought you said it was just a blade.	Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.	How much longer's that gonna take?
How much longer's that gonna take?	Like I always say --
Like I always say --	I know I know, two ways to do anything --
I know I know, two ways to do anything --	The right way and the wrong way.
The right way and the wrong way.	But how long?
But how long?	Hard to say.
What is it?	Threw a turbine blade.
If you get it back in one piece.	It's a risk I'm willing to take.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?	Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
Sudden flashes of light.	I feel fine.
Stay away. Or else.	Because of the gold.
That's a good thing?	Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.	That's what I call a payday.
Then why didn't they take it.	Probably didn't have time.
You mean, before she sank.	Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Could be a fishing boat.	Too big. More like a freighter.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.	I bet you did.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?	I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.	Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?	I think I see it pretty well.
I think I see it pretty well.	It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
They went crazy.	Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
Over the gold.	Maybe it was more than that.
What's that supposed to mean?	I don't know.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.	Victims of what?
Victims of what?	Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.	That much I think we've already established.
That much I think we've already established.	More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?	I don't know, are we?
Collision? With what?	The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.	But where's the damage?
But where's the damage?	Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.	If it was a ship she hit.
Smashed it up pretty bad.	But, who -- ?
How's he doing?	Same. Any luck?
Same. Any luck?	No. I'll try again later.
You just shoot at something?	Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?	No cowboy shit. Right.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.	Did you see him?
There's somebody else on this boat.	What? What the hell're you talking about.
What? What the hell're you talking about.	I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.	You sure it wasn't me?
You're more practical than superstitious.	Only way to be.
She was sailing up north, right?	Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.	You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Can't find the shotgun.	So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.	Doesn't look like it much matters.
We're still drifting.	The mooring hasn't come taught.
How're you feeling?	Lost my sea legs.
Never been more thirsty in my life.	Drink up then.
We could call for help.	And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
I heard that.	Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?	Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
You're up late.	Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
Call the Coastguard?	Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
Too deep to anchor out there.	Looks like it's adrift.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.	Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.	I must be in the wrong business.
I must be in the wrong business.	You got that right.
You got that right.	"Better than ""making hamburger for Mickey D."""
Of course they did.	Let the buyer beware.
Let the buyer beware.	What do you say, Dodge?
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?	Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
I thought you say Tuesday.	Better late than never.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.	No, no. You got leak.
That cost me twenty grand at least.	Fifteen, at the most.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!	But I can't --
But I can't --	JUST DO IT!
Pumpkin, are you in there?	Are you going to yell at me?
"What do you mean ""on his way up""!?"	I just buzzed him in.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.	What is it now?
What is it now?	Are you still looking for a job?
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?	I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
How should I know?	Someone from the past.
Have you seen my blue spatula?	Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?	Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...	Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...	Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.	What do you mean?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?	I didn't check my messages...
So what do you think?	I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Did you actually do this painting?	"Well, no - it's more like a ""found art object."""
Who is this, Enid?	It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.	I see... interesting...
And what can you tell us about this...	Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.	It's not optional!
Because if you do, I'll kill you!	Okay... I promise.
Then why do you hate me so much?	When did I say I hated you?
When did I say I hated you?	You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
That's just the way I am!	Yeah, well --
Hi... what's up?	Can I come in?
I just stopped in to say hi.	Yeah, well... hi...
Jesus, look at this guy.	Oh my God, that's HIM!
That guy rules!	Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Do you want anything?	Maybe an orange juice.
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?	"I said ""great""..."
"I said ""great""..."	Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...	It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...	What? When did you see Josh?!
What? When did you see Josh?!	He came into work.
He came into work.	Why? What did he say?
Do you still want to do something tonight?	What happened to Seymour?
What happened to Seymour?	I can't believe it - he actually scored!
So should I come over?	Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...	What are you talking about? Who?
What are you talking about? Who?	Just some people from work...
Just some people from work...	I don't believe you.
Look, we have to get these...	I can't afford stuff like this right now.
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?	Don't you want nice stuff?
Don't you want nice stuff?	I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?	Yeah, I guess... call me...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?	I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Wasn't it like eighth grade?	Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?	...maybe we should be lesbos...
...maybe we should be lesbos...	Get away from me!
He gives me a total boner!	He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
That guy is totally amazing.	He does that every single day.
Give me all your money, bitch!	Where did you get that?
Where did you get that?	You won't believe it! Guess!
No way... when?	Just now... I went with Seymour.
I totally, totally hate you.	Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
It's a surprise.	I don't believe you.
How about this?	Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
Ew ... when did you get that?	This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.	God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
How about this one?	Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
I didn't get it either.	Everybody's too stupid!
Why are we going here? I hate this place.	It'll only take a second.
I'll bet he never jerks off...	Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.	Should we leave a note?
Where are we going?	Let's go hassle Josh.
We still have to go in there sometime.	It's always closed...
Just promise you'll do it.	Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?	Come on, it's too late now...
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.	I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
What's he doing now?	He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
It's obviously him!	I can't believe it!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?	What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
"I want to ""make love"" to him."	I'm going to tell him you said that.
Look, maybe that's him!	It's still twenty-five minutes early.
Why do I always have to do it?	You're better at it.
Look, that's back when I hated you.	I remember every minute of that party.
I remember every minute of that party.	There's my dad with Joanie.
Look at how cute I am!	What a little hosebag.
Hey - why do you have this?	You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.	I've been looking all over for this.
So what should we do?	Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.	What is this?
Does Oomie really like this show?	Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.	Oh, we totally have to.
"I know... and instead of ""dessert"" it says ""Mindbenders."""	What does that even mean?
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?	I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?	You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...	That lets us off the hook.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!	We should follow them!
Did you sign up yet?	Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
"Since when is she an ""actress""?"	I know, she needs to die immediately.
God, what a bunch of retards...	I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What about me? Am I not even here?	Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?	What are you doing here, Melorra?
Well, we won't keep you.	"I love this place... it's so - you know, ""funky."""
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.	So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...	Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.	Where did you get those pants?
You still interested in that?	I thought it wasn't for sale.
I thought it wasn't for sale.	I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...	It's kind of falling apart.
Go die, asshole!	Get a job!
"Oh, how ""punk."""	That tape sucked, by the way!
That tape sucked, by the way!	I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Didn't they tell you?	Tell me what?
Tell me what?	Punk rock is over!
Punk rock is over!	I know it's over, asshole, I --
That's not even --	Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
I did too!	Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...	Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
You're late, asshole.	Fine, and how are you?
Fine, and how are you?	Did you bring that tape?
God, Dana's going to kill you!	...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?	What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...	I will if you want to.
I will if you want to.	No... forget it...
No... forget it...	I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...	Yeah, well... me neither...
So where would we go?	Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?	I dunno, I...
What do you want?	What do you want?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...	What about this?
What are you doing here?	I had to see you.
Can you at least let me in?	Uh... sure... come in.
What's the matter?	Do you have anything to drink?
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.	And you like them?
"What does she mean by that - ""somebody like me""?"	Just someone so young...
I... I don't think so.	Does that mean you don't like me?
Does that mean you don't like me?	No, of course not.
No, of course not.	So, do you like me, Seymour?
So, do you like me, Seymour?	In what way do you mean?
In what way do you mean?	In whatever way you think I mean.
...What do you mean?	Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
...I better not...	Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?	I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...	Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?	Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
Wow!  What was that all about?	It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
What, like a girdle?	Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...	Are you okay?
You can open your eyes now.	Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...	No, Doofus... blow it out!
You work at Cook's Chicken?	For nineteen years...
For nineteen years...	What are you, a fry cook or something?
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.	C'mon, Seymour, please?
I don't think so...	PLEASE? We have to!
PLEASE? We have to!	I really don't think it's a good idea.
I really don't think it's a good idea.	Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Well are --	Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Yeah, sure, I guess...	Watch my stuff.
How much is it?	A dollar seventy-five.
Is this one any good?	Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.	Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Well, here's where the fun never stops!	Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.	Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
What do we have here, Margaret?	It's a tampon in a teacup...
She's not at home?	No... they said she was here...
Why would she be hiding from me?	I don't know... where is she, then?
I don't know... where is she, then?	Maybe she's with Josh?
Maybe she's with Josh?	Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Why? What did she tell you?
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?	I have no idea - I just want to...
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.	Did she say that?
What do you mean?	On that pathetic fake blind date.
On that pathetic fake blind date.	What are you talking about?
Thank you, doctor.	Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-	-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
Morning, friend, glorious day.	As are they all.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.	He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
You were contracted to work-	-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.	Let me see the sick.
Let me see the sick.	Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?	There is no reason for fear.
Starting now, we attack them.	How; we don't know where they are?
I am a man of peace.	Am I to take it you want to live?
Am I to take it you want to live?	Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Understand, I had help-	-not a time for modesty, Bob-
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?	It hasn't been that simple so far.
Yes he is.	Well, I need to speak to him.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.	Don't they, though?
Don't they, though?	So work must be going well?
You've never built in Africa.	But I have in India- every country presents problems.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.	You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited.	You don't enjoy killing, do you?
You don't enjoy killing, do you?	Then why do it?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-	-please- you needn't be so graphic-
-please- you needn't be so graphic-	"You intend ""sorting this out"" tonight?"
You never had it.	Nigel and I don't like each other much.
Very good indeed.	We have hunted since childhood.
What a good week.	You mean nobody died?
But you said they were always old.	That's what the books say...
John, it will not be easy.	Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands-
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-	-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.	That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent.
I don't suppose I could watch.	Might be exciting for you.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.	You think they'll come then?  Why?
What happened to them?	I got big.
Think about something else.	Have you ever failed?
Have you ever failed?	Only in life...
...misfire... it jammed...	Has it ever done that before?
I can try.	Samuel says you killed a lion.
Samuel says you killed a lion.	It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
That's very considerate.	I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.	What did I do?
What did I do?	Got me out of trouble.
Got me out of trouble.	Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.	We need to talk.
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard.	Somehow I guessed.
Afraid of lions.	It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit-
Where is it?	Underneath.  Somewhere.
You like him, don't you?	Oh yes. But it takes time.
Oh yes. But it takes time.	You've known him long?
You've known him long?	Since his beard was red.
I expect so- it's from my wife.	Do you love her?
Do you love her?	I do, actually; very much.
I do, actually; very much.	You give me hope, John.
Oh yes, I think so.	Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
What are they looking at?	You- they cannot believe you're still here.
I am also liaison between these two.	Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Did it look like this in your mind?	This is more difficult-
Some mysteries should not have solutions.	Hold your son high.
Where do you go next?	Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?	Help finish the railroad.
Did you ever see a lion that size?	Not even close.  What happened?
How many cattle?	Four should do it.
Four should do it.	They will want a lot of money.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?	I don't believe you had a mother.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.	Everybody has a choice.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.	Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
Does he ever mention me?	No.  Not that I can recall.
No, you didn't, Frank.	Okay, that's no problem.
Okay, that's no problem.	That's exactly what you said last week.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?	That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
That's a terrible thing to say.	So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?	I don't know what to do anymore.
So this is what you do, huh?	Oh, hello, Peter.
Oh, hello, Peter.	You're really good, you know.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.	Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.	You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?	I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
That's where the buggy stopped.	Okay, let's take a look.
His name is Oscar.	Oscar!  You poor kid!
Can I help you?	Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
Should we go?	I don't think we should leave her alone.
I don't think we should leave her alone.	You're right.  We should stay.
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.	How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --	Yes, the scourge --
Yes, the scourge --	-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --	-- the sorrow --
-- the sorrow --	I command you.
I command you.	I await the word of Vigo.
These boys aren't playing around.	You've got to stop them.  Please!
You've got to do something!	Who are they?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?	Did I forget something?
Can I have some of your water?	Get on with it, counselor!
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.	I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.	You were the one who got me in.
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.	Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
From where -- Neptune?	They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.	Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.	They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
"That's it?  ""I'll be back?"""	It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
You were supposed to help me with this.	You need the exercise.
That's a thousand million electron volts.	I knew that.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.	I don't even want to know where that is.
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!	Do it!  Just do it!
Six feet -- seven -- eight --	That's it.  It's on the bottom.
That's it.  It's on the bottom.	Nine feet -- ten --
I'm Egon --	And we're the ...
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?	"His nickname is ""The Hammer."""
Nothing.  Not a trace.	Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.	There's something very familiar about this painting.
Rivers of the stuff!	And it's all flowing toward the museum.
Is the line sinking?	No, the slime is rising.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.	We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.	Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.	I hate Jello.
And now you're going to eat it?	No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
I'm Ray --	I'm Peter --
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.	Okay, let's heat 'em up!
Who?  Who?  Who?	Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Great.  So what are you guys working on?	Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.	Oh, Ray --
Oh, hiya, Pete.	So, no goat hooves, huh?
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?	Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Are you telling me how to drive?	No, I just thought --
No, I just thought --	Well don't think!
Now that's one ugly dude.	Huh?  What?
Huh?  What?	You finished here?
You finished here?	What?  Yeah.
What?  Yeah.	Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Tell him about the toaster.	I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
Now where are you going?	To the bathroom, where do you think?
To the bathroom, where do you think?	Have I done the right thing?
Roy?  Your clock broke.	Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.	I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
Aren't you glad we waited?	I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.	Well, thanks a lot.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.	Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Ready?  What is it?	Ummm -- figure eight?
No.  They're just coming to me.	Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
Are you the Gatekeeper?	I am Zuul.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.	I got the Twister game for later ...
... I thought it was the drug store.	Are you sick, Louis?
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.	I want you inside me.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.	Whoa!! Nice voice.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?	I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
You heard it?	You're the best one in your row.
All right.  What do you want to do?	I think I should spend the night here.
I think I should spend the night here.	That's it.  Get out.
That's it.  Get out.	On a purely scientific basis.
You're quite a housekeeper.	I told you, I ...
I told you, I ...	I know.  It happened by itself.
Well, let's check it out.	I'll wait here if you don't mind.
You really don't act like a scientist.	No?  What do I act like?
No?  What do I act like?	Like a used car salesman.
Like a used car salesman.	Thanks.  What's in there?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.	Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?	I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.	That's a violin concerto.
That's a violin concerto.	Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
Is that your professional opinion?	It's in the stars.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...	Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
Did you see it?  What was it?	We'll get back to you.
What's that got to do with it?	Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
I want you to have this.	What is it?
I don't believe in luck.	Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Die in what sense?	In the physical sense.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.	Oh, that's very - unusual.
Oh, that's very - unusual.	I think it's the food of the future.
I think it's the food of the future.	Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.	The EPA?  What's he want?
May I please see the storage facility?	Why do you want to see it?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.	Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?	I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.	I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?	You could say that.
You could say that.	And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?	I'm not at liberty to say.
In a storage facility.	And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?	Yes, it would.
Yes, it would.	And may I see this storage facility?
And may I see this storage facility?	No, you may not.
No, you may not.	And why not, Mr. Venkman?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?	Because you didn't say the magic word.
Because you didn't say the magic word.	And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?	"The magic word is ""please."""
Great!  How's it going?	Are you Peter Venkman?
Are you Peter Venkman?	Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.	I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!	Then my theory was correct.
Yes.  I don't like this.	Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?	Two wavy lines?
Two wavy lines?	Sorry.  This isn't your day.
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?	They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.	Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.	I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
Were you recently in the bathroom?	What on earth gave you that idea?
Life is just a state of mind.	But it's my favorite state.
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...	No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.	What is it?
Trust me.  It will be bad.	"What do you mean ""bad?"""
Something was definitely here.	Yeah, I can smell it.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?	I'm always serious.
Oh!  You're here.	What have you got, Egon?
Set entry grid.	Neutronize.  System shut.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?	God, it's ugly!
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!	What?  What popped in there?
Agile bastard, isn't he?	Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.	I don't think it's Shandor.
Who was the architect?	He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?	It's not good, Pete.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.	Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.	How do you know?
How do you know?	I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
Ray -- Something's here.	Where are you, Pete?
Where are you, Pete?	Third floor.  Get down here,
Third floor.  Get down here,	Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.	Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
So do I.	No sense worrying about it now.
How was your date?	It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.	Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
You'll never regret this, Ray.	My parents left me that house, I was born there.
For what purpose?	To go into business for ourselves.
I told you it's real.	What do we do now?
What do we do now?	I don't know.  Talk to it.
I don't know.  Talk to it.	What do I say?
What do I say?	Anything!  Just make contact.
"What do you mean by ""seen?"""	Looked at with your eyes.
Looked at with your eyes.	Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
What's he talking about?  Choose what?	"What do you mean ""choose?""  We don't understand."
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.	Right.  We'll believe anything.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.	Do you believe in God?
Do you believe in God?	No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.	Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.	The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
And the seas would boil ...	Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Right.  And the sky would fall ...	Judgement Day ...
Judgement Day ...	Yeah, Judgement Day.
I am their hero!	Not yet, dear brother...
Not yet, dear brother...	Send them out!
What are you talking about?	Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.	If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.	But I get what I want, always, don't I?
If I may be so bold...	For the gods, spit it out!
For the gods, spit it out!	Why not do it in the Colosseum?
We're nearly there, Lucilla.	That's what you told me two days ago!
They won't break this one.	Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
That's difficult to say, general.	Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.	I wouldn't know who to bet on.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.	Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Marcus Aurelius has died.	He left us at dawn.
Where is my father?	Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
I've read of it.	But have never been?
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.	We all know what right is, Senator.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.	You don't know how wrong you are.
You cannot die.	Would that Marcus had lived.
Would that Marcus had lived.	Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.	He killed his father and then my family...
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.	Yours will do!
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.	Sneaking around with your brother?
The Senators admire you.	They fear me.
As soon as I can.	On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?	On my honor as your daddy...
You brought the army into Rome.	I was summoned.
My troops don't make policy.	Well, they die for it!
Let him trust Quintus.	Quintus is overly idealistic.
Quintus is overly idealistic.	I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
You need to come home!	I can see that...
What about their philosophy lessons?	They're studying with Cynics.
He's very realistic.	Isn't the helmet magnificent?
I want nothing to do with the arena.	Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
How much money is involved?	A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.	Then get a large cash advance.
Before they leave, get gold.	Right, right, what am I thinking of?
You get to come alive again in the country!	As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.	Don't be ridiculous.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?	I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.	That's one way to look at it.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --	-- to fight?  We'll see...
The day after tomorrow?	Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.	He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.	Oh no. He said that.
Why do you have to see him?	Well -- I said I might marry him.
Why wouldn't it?	I just don't think it would...
I just don't think it would work.	Why wouldn't it?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.	Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?	I'll think about it.
I'll think about it.	You really will?
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.	I don't see how we can.
I don't see how we can.	We just can.
We just can.	I have to go back now.
I don't know.	But you might.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.	You mean you're confused?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.	I don't understand.
What are you going to do now?	I don't know.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?	If you want.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.	Elaine -- that is not what happened.
Because it isn't true.	I don't feel well.
I don't understand --	Did you say rape her?
What did she say?	Let me go.
Let me go.	You've got to tell me what she said.
I said I think it is.	All right then! Yes!
All right then! Yes!	Well, I want you to leave.
Well, I want you to leave.	Elaine -- I love you.
Elaine -- I love you.	How could you do that, Benjamin?
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?	Because -- I am.
Because -- I am.	Is it because I'm here?
Is it because I'm here?	What do you think?
What do you think?	I think it is.
-- really incredible --	Here he comes.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?	I thought he said by the monkey house.
Where are you meeting this person?	At the Zoo.
What is it?	That woman --
That woman. The older woman.	You mean the one who --
Why aren't you ready?	Because I want to know what's happening.
Benjamin -- what's happening?	Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
With a family?	Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.	Did they ever find out?
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.	Benjamin -- do they know you?
Benjamin -- do they know you?	Of course not.
We won't. Let's go inside.	Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.	Is anything wrong?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?	No, I couldn't.
No, I couldn't.	But could you try?
I want to go home.	But could I just tell you this one thing?
Will you take me home now?	I'm sorry I took you in there.
I'm sorry I took you in there.	I think I'd better go home now please.
I think I'd better go home now please.	But, Elaine --
But, Elaine --	Where is the car?
Where is the car?	I just want to tell you something.
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?	No -- why should I?
No -- why should I?	I don't know.
Do you want some dinner?	I'd love some.
Hello -- who is this?	This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.	Is the doctor anywhere?
Yes, I will.	Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Are you listening?	Yes I am.
I am going to call the police now.	Could I make one phone call first?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.	Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.	It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
One of those outside agitators.	Oh -- no sir.
Oh -- no sir.	I hate that. I won't stand for it.
I said -- not exactly -- no.	What are you then?
What are you then?	Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
Where are you?	Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.	Did you get a room?
I'm putting it here by the door.	Will you bring it in to me?
Will you bring it in to me?	I'd rather not.
I'd rather not.	All right. Put it in the room where we were.
I'm in the bathroom.	Well here's the purse.
Well here's the purse.	Could you bring it up?
Could you bring it up?	Well I'll hand it to you.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?	I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Is anything wrong, sir?	What? No. Nothing.
What? No. Nothing.	Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?	Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.	Where is it?
Where is your luggage?	Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.	Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
A room. I'd like a room, please.	A single room or a double room?
A single room or a double room?	A single. Just for myself, please.
A single. Just for myself, please.	Will you sign the register, please?
The Singleman party, sir?	Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.	It's in the main ballroom.
It's in the main ballroom.	Ahh -- thank you.
Can I help you, sir!	What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
I'll find her.	I don't think so.
Hello. Get me the police, please.	Where is Elaine?
Mrs. Robinson --	I can makes things quite unpleasant.
I don't believe you.	Then you'd better start believing me.
Go home now.	I just don't believe you would do that.
Then give me your word you won't.	This is absurd.
This is absurd.	Promise me, Benjamin.
Thank you.  Benjamin --	Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
If that's how you feel --	But it's not.
May I stay then?	Yes. Please. I want you to.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.	Now don't start this.
Don't start acting hurt.	Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Did I say that?	Of course you did.
I wouldn't know.	Well, I'm not.
Do you understand that?	Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
But why shouldn't I?	I have my reasons.
I have my reasons.	Then let's hear them.
I wish you'd tell me.	There's nothing to tell.
Don't talk about Elaine.	Don't talk about Elaine?
Do you remember the make of the car?	Oh my God.
Oh my God.	Really. I want to know.
Really. I want to know.	It was a Ford, Benjamin.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.	A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Well how did it happen?	How do you think.
We'd go to his car.	Oh no. In the car you did it?
Oh no. In the car you did it?	I don't think we were the first.
What was your major?	Why are you asking me all this?
Why did you do that?	See if you can guess.
See if you can guess.	Well I can't.
Well I can't.	Think real hard, Benjamin.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --	Well, wait a minute. You married him.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.	Calm down, Benjamin.
Calm down, Benjamin.	Now let's keep going here.
Now let's keep going here.	Can I undress and talk at the same time?
No we don't.	Well how long has this been going on.
Well how long has this been going on.	About five years.
About five years.	Oh no. Are you kidding me?
How many times a year.	On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.	Man, is this interesting.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --	We've talked enough, Benjamin.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.	Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
But you don't hate him.	No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.	Well how do you feel about him, then?
How do you get out of the house?	I walk out.
I walk out.	You walk right out the door.
There isn't any.	There's no risk?
What novel did you read.	I don't remember.
Do you really want me to?	Yes I do.
Yes I do.	I got up.
How about art.	Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.	You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.	Go ahead then.
Go ahead then.	Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
If you want.	Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Well what do you want to talk about?	Anything. Anything at all.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?	Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
This is all terribly wrong.	Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Benjamin, is this your first time?	Is this -- what?
Is this -- what?	It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
You can admit that, can't you?	Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?	It's nothing to be ashamed of --
It's nothing to be ashamed of --	Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!	On your first time --
On your first time --	Who said it was my first time?
Who said it was my first time?	That you're afraid --
That you're afraid --	Wait a minute.
Wood or wire? They have both.	Either one will be fine.
Why don't you watch?	Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Well -- do you want to go up first?	Yes -- I think that would be good.
Yes -- I think that would be good.	I'll be up in five minutes.
I'll be up in five minutes.	Well -- goodbye then --
Isn't there something you want to tell me?	To tell you?
Have you gotten us a room yet?	I haven't. No.
I haven't. No.	Do you want to?
Do you want me to get it?	You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.	Do you want to get it now?
Well -- I don't know.	Why don't you get it.
May I have a drink?	A drink? Of course.
How are you?	Very well. Thank you.
Yes, I do.	I've got to go.
Don't be nervous.	Get away from that door.
Get away from that door.	I want to say something first.
Let me out!	Do you understand what I said?
Do you understand what I said?	Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Yes. Yes. Let me out!	Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Where is it?	On that chair in the hall.
What if he did?	Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?	Don't you think he trusts us together?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?	Yes, I have --
What are you so scared of?	I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.	Then why do you keep running away?
I think I'll go to bed.	Oh. Well, goodnight.
Oh. Well, goodnight.	Won't you unzip my dress?
Won't you unzip my dress?	I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.	If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --	No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.	Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.	I know that. But I'm --
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.	What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?	Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
What do you think?	Well I don't know.
What do you think of me?	What do you mean?
Did you know that?	Look -- I think I should be going --
Look -- I think I should be going --	Sit down, Benjamin.
Please wait till my husband gets home.	When is he coming back?
When is he coming back?	I don't know.
All right then.	What do you drink?
Is it a girl?	Is what a girl?
Is what a girl?	Whatever it is you're upset about.
Whatever it is you're upset about.	Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?	It's down the hall.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.	Very good, sir.

Then whose name is it registered in?	Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?	Where are the papers?
Because if you are...	Lady! Be quiet.
Haven't we met before?	None of that, lady.
None of that, lady.	Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.	How long have you been driving?
Isn't this your vehicle?	No, no. I just took it.
Edith was just telling me about her job.	I'm a file clerk.
I'm a file clerk.	Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
And what do you do, my dear?	I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
A block of ice.	Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.	What do you see?
What do you want?	I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.	Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.	It's true. I can't live without you.
It's true. I can't live without you.	"""And this too shall pass away."""
But why now?	I thought eighty was a good round number.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.	But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Supper for two.	Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.	It's all right. It's organic.
It looks like you. Thanks.	Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?	I took them out.
Look at the stars.	Yes. They're old friends.
Yes. They're old friends.	Do you think there is any life up there?
Do you think there is any life up there?	I don't know. Perhaps.
You sure have a way with people.	Well, they're my species.
How about some candy floss?	Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
That wasn't very scary.	No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.	Oh, you weren't scared.
Don't you advance on me.	... of you. You'll all end up like this.
But they'll put me in jail.	Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Maude, I must speak to you.	What is it, Harold?
But they have.	Well, don't go.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?	No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Well, why don't you?	No. I'd feel stupid.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.	It's so blue.
It's so blue.	And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Maude, do you pray?	Pray? No.  I communicate.
Well, I really don't smoke.	It's all right.  It's organic.
It's all right.  It's organic.	I'm sure picking up on vices.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.	What was that?
I <u>think</u> I see it.	Yes. It's almost there.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.	Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.	But I don't play anything.
Well, I don't...	Oh come on. I'll teach you.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?	Well, I really don't drink...
Well, I really don't drink...	Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
We'll come back in the morning.	What is that he's working on?
Oh, my. We're too late.	Is he all right?
Is he all right?	He's fallen asleep, as usual.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?	Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.	Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
We'll transplant it. To the forest.	But we can't just dig it up!
Over there by the courthouse.	What is it?
What is it?	That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Why do you say that?	Because they are all the same.
Because they are all the same.	Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.	Certainly a new experience for me.
What do you think?	Oh. Eh, I like it.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>	It goes on and on.
It goes on and on.	That's really great.
Me! No. Of course not.	Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.	She seemed yare to me.
It's very interesting.	Oh, look! The birds.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?	No, thank you. I have my car.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?	Oh, of course. What is your name?
Eh, no. Thank you.	You're welcome.  Did you know him?
This is insane.	Perhaps it is.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.	Mother. I'm going to get married.
Mother. I'm going to get married.	Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?	I'm getting married.
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.	Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?	An ancient Japanese ceremony.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.	Like a tea ceremony?
Like a tea ceremony?	No. Like this.
Oh, is this your father?	No. My uncle.
Do you play?	No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Would you like a cigarette?	No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
I'd have liked to talk to him.	What would you say?
What would you say?	I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.	What kind of stuff?
None at all?	Well, maybe one.
Well, maybe one.	Would you care to talk about this friend?
Then why did you leave?	I burnt down the Chemistry building.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?	No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.	What else do you like?
Does that worry you?	Yes. It does.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?	You mean when I'm not working on a...
You mean when I'm not working on a...	Yes. What kind of things do you do?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.	And why is that?
Just give me a rough estimate.	Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
A rough estimate.	And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?	"I wouldn't say ""benefit."""
Stay where you are, Harold .	She took my head.
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.	Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Will they really teach me to shoot?	Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.	And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
How about to slit his throat?	Well, I don't...
Well, I don't...	I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.	Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.	Sir, how about souvenirs?
It's the greatest excitement in the world.	To pit your own life against another.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.	The moment of truth.
The moment of truth.	Another man's life in your sights.
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?	Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.	Well, it's a tricky turn.
Well, it's a tricky turn.	Eh, yes, ma'm.
Were you also the one who painted the statues?	Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?	Well, I didn't.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.	No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.	Time to play.
It's different for us.	We've always been here.
We've always been here.	We have no more surprises.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.	Oh, I do. I do.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!	I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
He... he loved me.	Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
I knew you'd come back.	I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
She's done it.	She certainly has.
Yes... Yes. You look...	Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?	No. You look...
O.K. Let's go.	Kyle, you don't have...
Get out of the way.	Are you crazy?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	The boxes! I TOLD you.
The boxes! I TOLD you.	You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...	Yeah. The things you were talking about.
The box. I need the box.	The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...	Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
No bad dreams.	So you slept O.K.?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.	What's the matter with her?
So... You're Kirsty, huh?	You a doctor, too?
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.	What are you talking...
What are you talking...	I've got to finish it.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!	Then why are you here?
Then why are you here?	I've come for my father!
What are you talking about? Who are you?	Oh, excuse me...
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.	Is he serious??
Is he serious??	Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
Remind me why I keep doing this.	Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.	Oh, right --
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.	Didn't even buy me a drink.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?	I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
You were burned by some organic acid.	I'm lucky that way.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.	We don't take hints.

Just take it slowly.	Oh, sod you.
Got her mother's looks.	Her mother's dead.
Alright, let's give it another try.	Do you really need this bed, lady?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.	It'll go in.
We've got such sights to show you --	You can keep them.
Just in time.	Stay the fuck away from me.
We want the man who did this --	No. That wasn't the deal.
Nobody escapes us.	HE did. I've seen him.
No time for argument.	You did this before, right?
Let me alone, will you?	No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
The box... you opened it. We came.	It's just a puzzle box.
You were holding onto it like grim death.	I don't remember.
Please. Get back into bed.	I have to speak to my father.
I have to speak to my father.	That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Come to Daddy.	This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.	Some things have to be endured...

I said no.	Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
Let me see.	Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.	What kind of doors?
You're still afraid.	You would be. They tore me apart.
You would be. They tore me apart.	So you were cheated.
A long time.	You promised me an explanation.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.	Keep your voice down.

You look terrible. Have you had an accident?	I was here this afternoon.
I saw everything.	I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
What's the problem?	I have to see my father.
I have to see my father.	Of course. There's no need to shout.
Hi. I got soaked.	There's a towel in the bathroom.
There's a towel in the bathroom.	Which is where?
Which is where?	Just to your left.
I don't know where to begin...	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	It's better you see for yourself --
What's wrong with you?	Please. I can't bear it...
Don't go upstairs.	Come with me then.
-- I'll go see.	No. I'll do it.
Is this upsetting you?	I've seen worse.

I'm going to throw up.	No, you're not.
What have you done?	I cut myself.
How are you doing through there?	It looks like a bomb's dropped.
You're still blaming me.	No. I'm not.
No. I'm not.	You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
Not exactly modern.	We'll sell it. Sell everything.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.	I thought half of it was your brother's?
Why didn't he want to sell it?	I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
How long since you were here?	The best part of ten years.
It smells damp.	It's just been empty a while.
It's ONE of these.	We're going to freeze to death.
Why don't you do the same?	Maybe I will.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.	Yeah, why don't I?
I suppose not.	I prefer the floor.
What's going on?	We don't need a bed, do we?
Is this your place ?	Do you care ?
Do you care ?	No, not much.
No, not much.	Let's keep it that way, shall we?
Let's keep it that way, shall we?	No personal details?
Well, isn't it?	I... suppose so, yes.
No. No. Let's go upstairs.	That's more like it.
You know it's not often I... you know...	There's a first time for everything.
There's a first time for everything.	I suppose that's right.
I suppose that's right.	You want something to drink?
What a pretty tune.	My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Who brought me in here?	I won't be a moment.
You're awake. Good girl.	What happened to me?
What happened to me?	I'll get the doctor.
I'll get the doctor.	Wait a moment --
Where are you going?	I have to get out.
Get the fuck out of here.	What's the problem?
What's the problem?	PLEASE. You're in danger.
PLEASE. You're in danger.	No. It's all over.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.	I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.	I'm afraid it's true.
I'm afraid it's true.	I want to see.
I want to see.	No you don't.
...maybe we should never have come back.	Maybe you should give it some time.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.	Never better. You sleep well.
I love you, honey.	I love you too.
Is Julia here?	Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
You will keep in touch.	Of course. Every day.
Take care, Dad.	Call me tomorrow.
Call me tomorrow.	I will. See you.

Where are you?	I found a room.
I found a room.	What did you say?
What did you say?	I said: I found a room.
I'll come back later, huh?	Sure. Why not?
What did I say?	Will you GO, damn you?
Don't let them take me, Steve --	I won't let anybody take you.
Steve. Thank God you came.	What happened to you?
Are you busy after work ?	Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.	Can I lend you a hand?
Are you alright ?	I've been better.
I've been better.	Your father told me you were working here.
Your father told me you were working here.	If I make it through the day.
If I make it through the day.	I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.	No, it's good to see you.
It's not what I heard.	Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
I beg your pardon?	There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?	We're not all frigid.

I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --	You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.	Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?	Can I help you?
I'll tape it for you.	No, that's okay.  Really.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.	Well, I'll just make it for you.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.	You look upset.
You look upset.	I'm upset, but I'm fine.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.	Maybe I should talk to him.
Maybe I should talk to him.	Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.	Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.	Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Laura?  Are you okay?	I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?	We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
Can I help you?	Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.	I mean it.
Would you marry me if I was?	No.  Probably not.
No.  Probably not.	Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?	Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?	I don't know.
Just local, of course.	"And the ""triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?"" ""Triumphant?"" ""Return?"""
Barry said its done.	Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?	Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?	To make you feel better.
C'mon.  I want to know.	Want to know what, exactly?
Want to know what, exactly?	What it was like.
What's the difference?	You know the difference.
You know, with Ray...	Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.	What do you mean?
I don't want to go back.	What do you want to do?
Look, are you coming or not?	Yes, of course.
No, no.  When are you going home?	In a minute.  When I get it together.
Who the fuck's Pig?	My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
Don't forget your CDs.	Those aren't mine.
Those aren't mine.	Sure they are.
You're being deliberately obtuse.	I guess I am.
I guess I am.	Well, think about it.
That bad, eh?	You know what I mean.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.	Will you call me?
Will you call me?	I don't have your number.
So, how are you?	Have you slept with him yet?
Have you slept with him yet?	I told you I slept with him.
I told you I slept with him.	No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --	Is that why you wanted to see me?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?	I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
We'll talk some other time.	Great... That's great.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.	Fine.  One.
Fine.  One.	It sounds stupid.
You won't like it.	Just ask it!
Just ask it!	Is it better?
Is it better?	Is what better?  Better than what?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?	Of course it is.
Of course it is.	You really think it would make a difference either way?
You really think it would make a difference either way?	I don't know.
I haven't felt like it.	But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
I suppose so.	So we have a chance of getting back together again.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.	Oh, Rob, shut up.
Did you say something?	No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?	Rob.  Don't be childish.
What were the others?	Just the obvious stuff.
Just the obvious stuff.	What's the obvious stuff?
What's the obvious stuff?	I don't know.
I think you know that.	Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.	But don't you remember?
-- Alright, alright but --	-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
I thought I could give you a lift back.	Are you coming home?
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.	I should be so lucky.
It's a crematorium.	You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.	What difference does it make?
What difference does it make?	Is Ray going?
Which way are you going?	That way.  You?
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.	I'll call you.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.	Oh, right.  Alright.
Are you okay?	Yes.  You?
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!	You haven't even seen it!
You haven't even seen it!	Nor have you!
So you live in Chicago now?	Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
Hello?  Anybody there?	I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.	You know that's not what's upsetting me.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.	Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I knew this was going to happen.	Then what are you getting so upset about?
She left.  She's gone.	What do you mean?  Where did she go?
Everything all right?	Great.  Super-fantastic.
Great.  Super-fantastic.	How's the store?
How's the store?	So so.  Up and down.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?	Sure.  Ten cents.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.	And I won't take a penny over ninety.
But you must have --	I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
What do you think?	It's the best collection I've ever seen.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.	Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
I think you have more.	Well we don't.
Well we don't.	I can't frisk you but the cops can.
Naw.  Those are for us.	Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
I warned you.	Go to hell.
How old is Richard?	P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.	Find the father.  That should clear things up.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.	Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
You're the expert.	It's in good condition.
Doesn't have a head, does he?	This one came unassembled.
You're very macabre.	It's my birthday.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.	I don't follow you.
Would you like more tea?	No thank you, I'm fine.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?	Anything in Maryland is close.
What is it?	I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
What is it you want?	All of it finished.
He knows about you.	He is older than I.
He is older than I.	What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
I didn't kill the watchman.	You killed those other two.
You killed those other two.	Not the same.
Not the same.	What about that family in '31?
What about that family in '31?	Sometimes innocents become involved.
There are differences.	You kill with your left hand?
You kill with your left hand?	I haven't killed _you_.
I haven't killed _you_.	Is that a threat?
Who are you?	That would be difficult to explain.
That would be difficult to explain.	I'd like you to try.
I'm not even sure why.	Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
You are a very perceptive young woman.	Just a little crazy.
A factor of age.	I hope I never get that old.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.	They do it each year.
You did kill those men.	Not all of them.
Not all of them.	When you finish, what then?
Is this what you killed them with?	You've been listening to rumors.
No one knows you're here?	No.  I had to talk to you.
No.  I had to talk to you.	You had to do _nothing_!
"He called you ""MacLeod""."	Not your concern.
That bothers you?	He was innocent.
I'd rather hear yours.	You are being foolish.
Who is he?	At the moment?  Carl Smith.
I have friends.	I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
You have an active imagination.	I've been to Church Hill.
Someone beat you.	Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
People like that rarely leave business cards.	Does Carl Smith?
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?	I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.	It's not mine.
I'm just curious.	"You're never ""just curious"".  You've met my neice, Brenna."
All fashionably without heads.	Spare me the details.
You're an asshole, Moran.	I want Taupin.
I want Taupin.	What makes you so sure he's the one?
What's all of this got to do with me?	What were you doing in Felton?
I'm calling an attorney.	You and I should talk first.
You and I should talk first.	We've got nothing to say.
Who is it?	Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
Corey, you _owe_ me.	It's that important?
Requiem acer'nam donaei-	What are you doing man?
What are you doing man?	-Et lux perpetua-
-Et lux perpetua-	You'll not be bringing the church into this.
It will take less effort as you learn.	It's like to kill me first.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!	Go to hell.
Harder.  Concentrate harder.	Me arm hurts.
Me arm hurts.	Again.  Try again.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.	Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.	This can't be.
This can't be.	You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.	This is madness!
This is madness!	It is the truth.
I don't understand.	You are still so very young.
Yes.  Always.	Does it change with me in the room?
Does it change with me in the room?	It is less.
It is less.	You feel you know me.
You feel you know me.	I don't know why.
I don't know why.	We are brothers.
You know me home.  Me name.	It was time for our paths to cross.
Your marks would suggest great injury.	I was nearly killed.
I was nearly killed.	But you lived.
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.	You're not from these parts.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.	You're not talking sense, Mara!
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.	That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.	Me father has taken back my hand.
I'm your future husband, remember?	I have no future husband.
Oh please.  Another one.	What would you like?
Romirez understood.  Not you.	Romirez is dust.
Who am I deceiving?	Certainly not me.
You see Major?  You are not so different...	I had no choice.
Do not turn your back on me.	You are really going to force this, aren't you?
You are really going to force this, aren't you?	Either you are with me or against me.
We must talk.	Stay out of it.
Stay out of it.	Don't threaten me, Private.
It can be different.  It must be.	It never changes, Major.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.	We have no understanding.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.	You seem to understand a great deal.
Must he go?	Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.	But Ian, he's still but a boy.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.	He's a MacLeod.
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.	Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Where did you learn that?	My father taught me.
My father taught me.	Your father must be smart.
Your father must be smart.	Yes, he was.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.	Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?	No.  I want this to be all ours.
Smith.  Carl Smith.	How many came?
How many came?	The last four.
The last four.	And the Bulgarian?
And the Bulgarian?	He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.	He knows I'm here.  How?
He knows I'm here.  How?	None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
I don't know.	What name is he using?
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.	You were never a kid.
I haven't drunk this much since-	-Since you last saw me.
He found us even there.	He always did.
How are you?	Head still secure to the neck.
Head still secure to the neck.	How did you find me?
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.	Leave her alone.
What's the point?	This isn't done.  Get up.
This isn't done.  Get up.	What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
It's all we have.	Go to hell.
Leave her out of this.	As you wish.
Yes laddie, I have her.	Should I care?
We have some unfinished business.	Are you here?
Are you here?	I want you to come to me.
I want you to come to me.	And if I refuse?
Do you know what this is?	I presume it's a sword.
What were _you_ looking for?	That's none of your business.
Steven, Conor didn't die.	But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
Nothing to be sorry about.	Just your pappy scared some.
You're one of William's kids, huh?	His only kid.
We were very close.	The resemblance is amazing.
The resemblance is amazing.	When may I expect the cleaners?
When may I expect the cleaners?	I'll send them right up.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?	Why don't you fellows get your own news?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.	Open this door!
Who is it?	What's the idea of locking this?
What's the idea of locking this?	That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
I'm getting married tomorrow.	Well, congratulations! Good luck!
I'll keep you in mind.	Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I got my rhyming dictionary in --	It doesn't have to rhyme!
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?	The poem?... The poem was great!
Oh, she was here.	Where'd she go?
Where'd she go?	Out some place.
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?	Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Did you finish the interview?	The Criminal Courts Building.
What's the matter?	I lost my wallet.
I lost my wallet.	The check, Bruce!
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?	Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
All right, dear.	Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?	The five hundred? Sure.
About twenty-five hundred dollars.	Better make that a certified check, Walter.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!	Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?	He certainly -- hic -- does!
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.	You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.	The money? Why?
The money? Why?	There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.	Gee! Take a look, will you?
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.	If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.	Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.	Thanks a lot.
Well, she'll know some day.	That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.	And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.	I'm beginning to realize that.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.	You haven't seen anything yet.
Anything the matter?	Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
Mother? But your mother --	No. My mother.
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.	Where are we going?
No, you don't!	Do you want to get us scooped?
Save that for the Tribune.	What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!	The power of the press, huh!
But, Hildy -- I can explain --	You -- you!!
How about Bruce's?	Walter, you can't do that!
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.	Where'd you wire him?
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!	Then why are you doing it?
Then why are you doing it?	Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
I don't know what to do, Walter.	Flip a coin.
How was that for a tight squeeze?	Don't tell me you were worried!
Don't tell me you were worried!	Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
When did you deliver this first?	Who did you talk to?
No, you don't! Walter!	What is it? Here!
Ring that number, will you?	Come here. See if we can move it.
Will you come here?	Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Hello -- hello...	Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.	Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?	Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.	What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Look at me, Hildy --	I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?	Was she? Did you notice?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?	What did you do with her?
How much do you want on it?	All the words you've got.
All the words you've got.	Where's some paper?
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?	Yes. Where is he?
Yes. Where is he?	She jumped out of the window.
She jumped out of the window.	I know. Where is he, I said.
Never mind that. What's the story?	Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Then what does he want with you?	Now you got me.
Now you got me.	Nothing personal. I was just asking.
You can't sell me that, Walter.	Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
What's his line?	He's in the insurance business.
He's in the insurance business.	The insurance business?
The insurance business?	It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.	Say, could I meet him?
Say, could I meet him?	Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.	You're not afraid, are you?
You're not afraid, are you?	Afraid? I should say not!
You've got to help me, Hildy.	Keep away --
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --	All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!	Please! Will you just --
Please! Will you just --	Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?	I'm not working for any other paper!
I have a lunch date. I just want --	You can break it, can't you?
You can break it, can't you?	No, I can't.
No, I can't.	Sure you can. Come on.
What do you mean by that?	Just what I said. That's what I --
Just what I said. That's what I --	You mean you're not coming back to work here?
You've had a better offer, eh?	You bet I've got a better offer.
How long is what?	You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!	You grey-haired old Judas!
You grey-haired old Judas!	Let me out! Let me out of here!
Are you referring to me, Madam?	You know you did!
You know me. The shirt off my back.	You got plenty of money?
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!	I always have both.
Anything you want, Boss.	Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.	Who do you want?
You stay here. I'll find out everything.	Western an' Thirty-fourth.
You're crazy. Where's Mac?	He's on my phone. He just called me.
He's on my phone. He just called me.	They can't do that to me!
Let's see the money.	First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?	It's a deal. Let me up.
There's money in it, Cooley.	I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?	I think it is.
I think it is.	I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.	You said it!
You said it!	They're always after me for interviews.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.	Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --	Point the gun at me!
Better let us in on it, Mollie.	Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
She looks as though she's going to come to.	Give me a hand with her, will you?
Give me a hand with her, will you?	Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
Open up there, will you!	All right -- all right!
Who locked the door?	Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
I call. What you got?	Three bullets! Any good?
Three bullets! Any good?	Beats king up.
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.	I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Hold the phone!	I'll have it in a minute.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.	Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
So have we!	What's the dope, Sheriff?
What's the dope, Sheriff?	Who engineered this getaway?
Boy, did you see her go?	Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
You guys wanna play some more poker?	What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.	Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.	Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
We know what you're up to.	Probably goin' out to get Williams.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!	Now, where is he?
What a chase!	No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Gus, this --	Good coffee, isn't it?
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.	That's all right.
No -- just coffee, Gus.	Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.	Little rum in yours, too?
Little rum in yours, too?	I guess so.
How's everything, Gus?	I can't complain.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.	He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.	Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Take your paws off me!	Hold her, boys!
Just a minute, Johnson!	Let go o' me. What's the idea?
After all I've done for you --	Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.	No, I couldn't do that.
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?	You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
That's a lie!!	I never saw him before!
Who is this man?	Throw him out, Frank.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?	A sight for sore eyes!
We'll fix that, too.	Just -- one -- second!
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!	Now what do you say?
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!	What is it?
Tell 'em to hold the wire.	I did.  Hold the wire.
I did.  Hold the wire.	Cover up that transmitter!
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!	Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Pete, you're through!	What do you mean -- through?
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?	I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Pete, I want to talk to you!	I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.	Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Got you, Williams!	Go on -- shoot me!
Now, Hildy --	Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.	You can let him out on bail, can't you?
You can let him out on bail, can't you?	Five hundred dollars.
Five hundred dollars.	You'll take fifty and like it!
Where's the old lady?	I'm telling you!
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!	My name is Louis Peluso.
There goes another scrub lady.	I'll go right after it.
Phone for you, Hildy.	Who is it?
Who is it?	Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?	Give me that!
Look out, you --	What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Did you get that, Hildy?	No -- what?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.	I thought so, too.
You fight it cut.	And up a dime.
Come on with that money!	First you got to sign a receipt.
First you got to sign a receipt.	Where's the money?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!	So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
What good'll it do?	We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!	Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.	How'd you get here, Earl?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.	Put down that gun, Earl.
Don't forget about production for use.	I won't, Earl.
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.	Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Very simple, Earl.	There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.	Isn't that her picture?
Isn't that her picture?	Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
Are you all right, now?	Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
What's the idea?	Never mind! Just play dead.
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.	I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Where are they gone? You know where they are?	Wait a minute, Mollie.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.	They're not human!
Here's the picture of my wife.	A very fine-looking women.
Get out of here!	You can't bribe me!
I'll explain it tomorrow!	Is it hard?
Is it hard?	No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
No, I don't think so.	For heaven's sake, why not?
The City Sealer's office!	You mean here in the city?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?	How much do you make a week?
What's from the Governor?	The reprieve for Earl Williams.
What's your hurry?	We want to see you.
Get the cops, somebody.	Come on, fellas.

What did all this stuff cost you?	When you've got money, you'll pay.
When you've got money, you'll pay.	No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Don't you ever cook anything?	Eggs. How do you like them?
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?	Museums... art galleries... concerts.
Where you been all day?	At school. It's Thursday.
At school. It's Thursday.	Oh, I forgot.
I'm not sure... I don't know.	Well, what do you want to know? And why?
What did you say that for, Sarah?	How did you know my name was Sarah?
How did you know my name was Sarah?	You told me.
You told me.	I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.	Okay. So what's your name today?
What time is it?	Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
A day like any other. People come, people go.	Give me a drag.
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.	I used to be an actress.
I used to be an actress.	Yeah? What do you do now?
You don't look like a college girl.	I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
So why go to college?	I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.	What do you do on the other days?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.	The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?	I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
It's the lights. And the scotch.	How come you didn't catch your bus?
How come you didn't catch your bus?	I wasn't waiting for a bus.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.	Then why go to the bus station?
Do you always ask so many questions?	No, not always.
Can I sit down?	Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.	Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
Have a nice trip.	Thanks. I will.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?	Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
...you shoot a great game of pool.	So do you, Fast Eddie.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.	I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
I came to play pool, Fats.	That's good, Eddie. For how much?
That's good, Eddie. For how much?	You name it.
You name it.	Thousand dollars a game.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.	Game's over, Eddie.
That's what the game's all about.	Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
I hear you've been looking for me.	Yeah. That's right, too.
Yeah. That's right, too.	Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
Shhh... don't talk.	I want to talk.  I just learned again.
Have you always had it?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Have you looked inside?
We don't know that --	I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
What do you want?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	You know what I mean.
Why don't you start with me?	You're not them.
Do you remember where you lived?	It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?	What about... now?
How much do you remember?	It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
You lived like this once.	That is not now, human!
That is not now, human!	My name is Robert.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?	They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
You built things.	I guess you could say that.
Hell of a night.	You got that right.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.	I was so scared.
I was so scared.	Better now, son?
That's a doozy of a dream, son.	It was so real, Dad.
I had an awful dream.	What, Jim, what?
What, Jim, what?	First lemme look at your necks.
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.	Was there anything over the hill?
Are you all right, Dad?	Sure ... fine.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.	I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
... and Rigel.	And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
There are more this year than last.	This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.	There's Cassius ...
Is the hill ours too?	If we want it, it is.
If we want it, it is.	Let's check it out, Dad.
What's that, Dad?	That's the Air Force Base.
We're going to be moving, son.	Do we have to?
I'm home now.	Yes -- but ...
Where's your car?	I left it at work.
What did he talk to you about?	He was upset with moving, I believe.
He was upset with moving, I believe.	Is that all he said?
Is that all he said?	Why, yes.  Why?
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.	Yes, Mr. Gardner.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.	May I ask why?
May I ask why?	We were having a little talk.
No one comes here after dark.	Hide the car.
Did you call the State Police?	All their lines were busy.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.	Who are you calling?
Who are you calling?	The State Police.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?	Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
I swear it was here.	But it's not, Jimmy.
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.	I don't see anything.
I don't see anything.	No, but it was here.
Do you know how to follow a map?	Yes.  I can even read star maps.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.	The back door was open.
Your father asked you a question.	What? -- I...
George, where have you been?	What happened to your other slipper?
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.	It's really nice of you to help us.
It's really nice of you to help us.	I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.	We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
Are you all right?	Did it work?
Did it work?	You bet it did.
You still believe in him.	He's a good man.
He's a good man.	Better be. You left me for him.
Just my luck, no ice.	I take it you've heard.
I take it you've heard.	A toast to the end of the world.
What do you want me to do?	I want you to leave with us. Right now.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?	Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
Connie, don't hang up.	David? How'd you get this number?
David? How'd you get this number?	Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
What do you want?	You have to leave the White House.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.	My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.	Punched the President? Oh my god.
We're losing them.	Then get them out of there.
That signal. It's a countdown.	A countdown to what?
Can you believe this?	What're you talking about?
What're you talking about?	Haven't you been watching?
There's good news and bad news.	What's the bad news?
What's the bad news?	You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.	And the good news is you won't charge me.
What the hell is this?	So sue me.
Pops, you're a genius!	What'd I say?
What'd I say?	A cold? Of course.
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?	I'm making a mess.
I'm making a mess.	This I can see.
You punched the President in the face?	He wasn't the President then.
Perfect, she's using it.	It's perfect the line is busy?
You try Martin?	She didn't take my name when we were married.
What the hell is that?	This, pops, is every phone book in America.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.	You still got the Olds?
Doesn't matter. Game's over.	I don't hear no fat lady.
Nice meeting you.	You as well.
What're you doing?	It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Get us out of here!	I can't shake her free.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?	Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
What the hell are you doing?	Just getting a feel for her.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.	Oh shit, we're late.
Oh shit, we're late.	We'll meet you there.
Grey, you read me?	Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?	I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
And our troops here?	We've been collecting planes from all over but...
We've been collecting planes from all over but...	But what, General?
How're we doing?	Better than we thought.
Where are they?	ETA with target; four minutes.
Is my wife in the air?	She should be shortly.
I had a feeling you would.	Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?	Then God help us.
This is ridiculous.	How long would their shields be down?
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.	This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
No Sir. Definitely not.	How do you know?
How do you know?	Well, er... it's slowing down.
Well, er... it's slowing down.	It's doing what?
It's doing what?	It's... slowing down, Sir.
You scared the hell out of me.	Yeah, but what an entrance!
Sorry for what?	I should have done this a long long time ago.
You know me...	I know, you like to make a big entrance.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.	They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
He's trying to impress you.	He's doing a good job.
So, what do you do for a living?	I'm a dancer.
He's my angel.	Was his father stationed here?
Stevie... I can't...	Jimmy, stay with me.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.	We're already over Mach 2!
We're already over Mach 2!	So push it!
I didn't even see them fire!	"Command, Eagle One. Switching to ""sidewinders."" We're moving in."
They let you out?	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?	Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Why did you people come here?	"Air... water... your ""sun."""
Peace? No peace.	What do you want us to do?
May we go home now, please?	The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!	Did you say...? Uh, uh...
My reputation precedes me.	There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.	And I am his.
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!	Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?	Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.	You are on your own?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!	It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
What about you?	I'm going after Dad.
Alexandretta. Now we know.	Yes. Now we know.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!	Dad was onto something here!
That doesn't look much like a library.	It looks like a converted church.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.	Do you believe, Marcus?
You know how long I've been looking for that?!	All your life.
All your life.	All my life!
Marcus!  I did it!	You've got it!
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!	Got lost in his own museum, huh?
The Word of God...	No, Henry. Try not to talk.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.	The Name of God...
Henry! What are you doing here?!	It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.	Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.	You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
An old man's dream.	Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
That was our assessment as well.	Where did this come from?
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!	It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
I never expected to see you again.	I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
All I have to do is squeeze.	All I have to do is scream.
You came back for the book? Why?	My father didn't want it incinerated.
How did you get here?	Where is it? I want it.
This one. I think he's in here.	How do you know?
What are you going to do?	Don't know. Think of something.
What do you know about this place?	I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
I said go around!	You said go between them!
You said go between them!	I said don't go between them!
It must be one of these...	Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
The Ark of the Covenant.	Are you sure?
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.	Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.	Lower me down.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?	I usually don't.
I usually don't.	I usually don't either.
I usually don't either.	In that case, I permit you.
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.	Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
After you, Junior.	Yes, sir!  Haaa!
I like Indiana.	We named the dog Indiana.
You call this archaeology?	Get out of there, Dad!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!	Dad, we're well out of range.
This is intolerable!	This could be close.
Those people are trying to kill us!	I know, Dad!
I know, Dad!	It's a new experience for me.
It's a new experience for me.	It happens to me all the time.
Dad, are we hit?!	More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!	What happens at eleven o'clock?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.	Fly... yes. Land... no.
What does that mean?	I don't know. We'll find out.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.	Dad, how can you?
Dad, how can you?	Very well. I'm here now.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?	We didn't talk. We never talked.
We didn't talk. We never talked.	And do I detect a rebuke?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.	I was the next man.
I was the next man.	Ships that pass in the night...
What did you get?	I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Brody's this way.	My Diary's in Berlin.
My Diary's in Berlin.	You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.	There is more in the Diary than just the map.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.	All right Dad -- tell me.
What final challenge?	Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.	What about Marcus?
What about Marcus?	Marcus would agree with me.
Marcus would agree with me.	Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
Come on, Dad. Come on!	What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
This is intolerable!	I'm out, Dad!
What am I looking for?	My lucky charm.
My lucky charm.	Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.	Try and burn through the ropes.
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.	So did I.
How did you she was a Nazi?	She talks in her sleep.
No! Don't Shoot!	Don't worry. He won't.
Look, can we discuss this later?	I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.	Will you take it easy!
I came here to save you.	Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
...you did it.	No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.	If only I could have been with you.
If only I could have been with you.	There were rats, Dad.
He was actually there? You saw him?	Well, what was left of him.
Well, what was left of him.	And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Oh, it breaks the heart.	And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!	I'll never forgive myself --
I'll never forgive myself --	Don't worry -- I'm fine.
It is you Junior!	Don't call me that, please.
Don't call me that, please.	But what are you doing here?
But what are you doing here?	I came to get you! What do you think?
Then wait -- count to twenty.	No, Dad. You listen to me --
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.	I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.	Who are you?
That was seven hundred years ago.	A long time to wait.
Where's my father?	They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
I'm going after those horses.	I'll take the camels.
I'll take the camels.	I don't need camels.
I don't need camels.	But, Indy --
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.	Come on -- come on!
Get that camel out of the way!	What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Who are you?	My name is Kazim.
My name is Kazim.	And why were you trying to kill me?
This is your last chance.	No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
Why are you trying to kill us?	Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.	Then we'll die.
Then we'll die.	My soul is prepared. How's yours?
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.	You think so?
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?	His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
That was a misunderstanding.	Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.	There are no stories anymore.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.	At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
You have insulted my son.	Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.	Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.	I don't like to show off.
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!	Read you loud and clear, Indy!
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.	You don't like him do you?
You don't like him do you?	Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
What you look at, Indy?	Just a statue.
I ride with you, Indy?	Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?	It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!	Step on it, Short Round!
Step on it, Short Round!	Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
No, the stones are mine!	You're betrayed Shiva.
That's far enough!	You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.	I don't understand. What's happened here?
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.	Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.	You will go to palace there.
The last Sankara Stone.	And they don't even know what it really is.
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!	What above the curves?!
What're we going to do?!	There's got to be another way out.
So now they believe me.	Yes, they believe you.
You've got to go to sleep now.	I want to go home...
Wait -- what're you doing?	I'm going down.
I'm going down.	Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!	I'm not leaving without those stones.
There's a hole! I found a square hole!	That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!	I am -- it looks horrible!
A fulcrum release lever!	I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!	Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
No -- don't you see -- crawling --	What -- the bug?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?	You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?	Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Primitive sexual practices?	You're talking to an authority in that area.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!	Maybe he likes older women.
Any more complaints?	Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
Couldn't keep away, huh?	Just try and control yourself.
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!	I know the feeling...
It's starting to let go!	That's good -- you're doing fine.
Can you move your arm?	Just one arm!
Don't let it pull you deeper!	It's pulling me deeper!
It's pulling me deeper!	Don't let it curl around you!
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!	Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
Indy! Help me!	Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
What'd he say?	He told me they knew I was coming here.
He told me they knew I was coming here.	What do you mean -- how?
What do you mean -- how?	The old man saw it in a dream.
The old man saw it in a dream.	Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!	The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!	Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!	Who cares? Where's that diamond!
I like the service here.	Hey, he's not a waiter...
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!	Willie, come on!
I get it!	You got it!
What are you doing?	Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.	Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
She is beautiful.	You've changed your mind.
She works for them.	Now, you're too suspicious.
Now, you're too suspicious.	You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!	I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
Where've you been?	Never mind that, where are we now.
Never mind that, where are we now.	We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?	Gimme a minute.
Gimme a minute.	Looks like you can have all you want.
This may hurt.	Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
There's a lot you don't know.	And don't let her know, either.
Are you alright?	Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
I can't handle that thing.	Don't worry, I can.
He hung us up dry.	While he makes the run.
What was it? What'd I say?	You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
You sure this will work?	Not sure at all.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...	I've got an idea.
I've got an idea.	I was afraid of that.
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.	No. You can't trust her.
He was with Gruner!	You were with GRUNER!
Door to the right. Get up and run.	I can't see a thing.
I can't see a thing.	Neither can they.
You have to! Quickly!	...imagine a better grape for the region.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.	I told you, I have a feeling...
I told you, I have a feeling...	One of your instincts?
Relax. Make your mind a blank.	It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.	What do I do?
What do I do?	Relax. Let me do this.
Just stay here and rest.	Where are you going?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.	That's not funny.
Come on, she's getting away.	I can't keep up.
You found her.	Better. I found Ryuji.
Better. I found Ryuji.	That's good. It's not better. Where?
Some agent you are.	Why don't you get out of my face.
You been had. We have.	It wasn't like that.
No. What will you do.	I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
And on my time.	It's not your time. I get time off.
It's not your time. I get time off.	You get time off to sleep.
She's got the most beautiful...s	Shit! You're in love.
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..	Is that all?
I don't know!	What she say. What'd you get out of her?
What am I supposed to do?	You got any books in there?
You got any books in there?	Oh come on.
Oh come on.	You shut down your sensors.
You shut down your sensors.	Joe! It's 56 hours!
What is it, your charm?	This just won't work.
This just won't work.	You're doing great with her.
You're doing great with her.	Not her. You!
Not her. You!	What is it?
What is it?	You can't listen. You can't watch either.
She's the toughest to read.	Maybe she's telling the truth.
They're all in it.	How do you know?
How do you know?	Voice stress analyzer.
Joe, be careful!	...I've lost something. I must get it back.
Just don't show fear.	I don't know what's going on.
I don't know what's going on.	It lends you an air of mystery.
I feel like an idiot.	Just hold them close and stay still.
Follow that busboy.	Are you serious?
Get close to them.	That place. By the window.
They both look good to me.	You have no taste.
Which one is she?	The beautiful one.
What did that cost?	You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Mind your own business.	It is my business. It's my name.
It is my business. It's my name.	But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Much too blue.	Not blue enough.
You really like that shirt?	This...is not going to work out.
What is it?	Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
But what's it look like?	What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.	Is something glinting?
Now, where would I be?	What are you looking at?
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.	Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Well you did it today.	Yeah. I did it.
Yeah. I did it.	But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
Where are you going?	To the hotel. To register.
To the hotel. To register.	Without your pants.
Without your pants.	Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Where is she staying?	Where are you staying?
What do I do?	Don't just stand there, say something.
Help me out, will you?	What can I do? You're on your own.
She doesn't seem to understand.	Try another language.
What is it?	She's beautiful...! What do I do?
Al, are you doing anything in there?	What? What do you mean?
What? What do you mean?	Are you screwing with any nerves?
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?	You eat it.
You eat it.	You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
It's just not enough.	It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.	What's wrong with how I carry myself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.	Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.	Oh yeah, to what?
Oh yeah, to what?	You'll be me.

He was right, wasn't he?	So. Now what?
I was devastated. Of course.	Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.

She answered our prayers.	Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
What did you do?	I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.

Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?	It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?	You are!  I don't like you.
You are!  I don't like you.	Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
We seem to have a little problem here?	What kind of problem?
What kind of problem?	I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.	What are you saying?
What is it?	It's a voice modulator.
How is she?	She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
Take it easy.  Both of you.	I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.	What was your relationship with her?
You think he's dirty?	I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
We'll find the evidence.	You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!	He was with me?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.	But a hundred men could move him.
A few people.	Did anyone stand out?
Did anyone stand out?	What do you mean, stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?	Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
I know where you are.	Very good.  How did you know?
The game's over.  You lost.	It's me you want.  Not her.
By that time the game will be over.	I've figured out the message.
What word did you leave last night?	The police haven't told you?
The police haven't told you?	They think that you and I are doing this together.
Have you any idea what the message is?	If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
Because she's the type.	But you said you didn't know her.
But you said you didn't know her.	I know what I said!  She looks just like...
I know what I said!  She looks just like...	Just like who?
Where is she?	You'll find her.
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?	To get your attention.
To get your attention.	Did you know her?
Did you know her?	No, only the path she chose to travel.
What is it?	New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.	1985.  Hans Korshaud.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.	He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
Nope.  Nothing.	Set up some pieces on the big board?
Why did he?	Why did he what?
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.	You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.	He already did once.
Okay.  Nice meeting you.	Nice meeting you.
I know he really likes you.	How do you know that?  Did he say something?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?	Not really.  It's pretty boring.
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.	I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.	But you promised.
What are you doing up?	I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
That has nothing to do with it.	You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
How long she been dead?	I'd say at least eighteen hours.
You mean, no prints but hers?	No Frank.  No prints.
How long has she been dead?	Six, eight hours tops.
Six, eight hours tops.	Any sign of rape?
The most logical choice.	You don't have a shred of evidence!
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.	What does that mean?
What time did he get there?	About a quarter to one.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.	That's a big area to cover.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.	This ain't no photo.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.	And this Jeremy--
We're not sure.	What do you think he did?
Ten days ago.	Do you know how she found the apartment?
Do you know how she found the apartment?	Through a rental agency.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.	I signed the confession.  What about the car?
Jeremy would have never killed himself.	Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
Where were you last night?	Are we going to go through this again?
Are we going to go through this again?	Answer the question.
Answer the question.	I went out.
Another one?  What word did he leave?	"""Is"".  Did you tell him about the institute?"
Could you tell me where you were last night?	Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
Feel like practicing?	Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
What do you see here?	Mate in five.
Mate in five.	Exactly... and you did this.
You have something you want to say?	Just thought you might want to talk.
Whatever's on your mind.	Who says something's on my mind.
You're always in the middle of a match.	I want to be the best I can.
It's a good play, but risky.	You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
He knows you're aware of that.	Then I'll transpose.
What are they, please?	"""Carefully"".  ""Carefully"". ""Carefully""."
I can check and call you back.	Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.	We'll call you back.
You beat him.	I got lucky.
You're going to be late for your match.	Are you going to come tonight?
Are you going to come tonight?	Yeah.  I'll be there later.
You're right.  The killer told me.	He didn't tell you either.
"How did you know it was ""carefully""?"	Frank told me.
Frank told me.	No he didn't.
It could be anything.	It's got to be grammatically correct.
Because I know what it says.	Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.	You don't understand.
You don't understand.	Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.	It's not that easy.
I thought you said the line was busy?	I tried again and got through.
Did you call?	The line was busy.  I'll try again.
I just don't want to fight with you.	Then show me who you are.
I'm not playing a game now.	Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.	What is this?
What is this?	I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.	What?  By attacking me?
Wasn't I just talking about me?	No.  You were talking about chess.
No.  You were talking about chess.	Alright.  What about me?
Alright.  What about me?	I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?	She died in a car accident.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.	It must've been very hard on Erica?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?	No.  But I'm open to distractions.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.	I'm sure you are.
I know you didn't	You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.	Doesn't that scare you?
I know it was bad.	How could you?  Unless you were there.
You mean like in the steam room?	That's not fair!
I think it's interesting.	Another kind of game?
Another kind of game?	In a way.
In a way.	This isn't a game.
You sound like my mother.	It wasn't intentional.
You sure you don't want to eat something?	I don't think I could.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.	She could be dead after the game.
She could be dead after the game.	She could be dead now.
What are you looking for?	Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.	No you didn't.
Well, I think I've had enough.	Getting too hot in here for you?
Do you always open quickly?	Are we talking about me, or chess?
When I was very young.	It seems like such a complicated game.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?	I'm not nervous.
In the Arctic ice.	That way. I can feel the cold.
Take the western passage.	All directions are the same here.
Will your power outward.	I don't know how.
I don't know how.	You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
You must move away from the Center.	All the passages are guarded.
I will find you. I will be with you.	I know it.
I know it.	I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...	Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?	In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Have they harmed you?	No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.	Never mind my ears! Go away!
We're almost married.	We're not married <u>yet</u>.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.	I don't have to go through with it either.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.	Well, you're beautiful.
You will go alone.	I won't leave you here.
They have Lyssa!	You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
It was a platonic kiss, Father.	Of course it was.
You're coming with us.	It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.	No! You cannot know that!
No! You cannot know that!	I can. Because I choose it.
I can. Because I choose it.	I forbid you!
I chose the wrong passage.	She can see the Beast!
She can see the Beast!	Use your sword.
Use your sword.	What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
The spiral begins in the west.	Where the spiral begins.
She must make a glaive.	Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Can she be forced?	No. She must agree of her own free will.
I'm not sure.	But you suspect.
But you suspect.	You will know, in good time.
I can't reach her.	What do you see?
What do you see?	Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
You choose these?	Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
You have not slept in two days.	Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
There is nothing.	Reach out farther. Call to her.
Reach out farther. Call to her.	Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
You have rope?	I am too old to climb down a rope.
I am too old to climb down a rope.	You won't have to.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?	There is no other way.
There is no other way.	But there is another entrance to this place.
The White Castle has fallen.	Does the Queen live?
Does the Queen live?	The new Queen lives.
The new Queen lives.	Turold's son was to marry her.
Each to his fate.	Each to his fate.
It is today?	Yes. It is today.
They can be saddled.	You have done it?
You have done it?	I road them often in my youth.
Do not let the waters touch you.	What will happen?
How did you know?	I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.	You will not, then?
You too are lonely.	I ache with it.
I ache with it.	Let me comfort you.
Let me comfort you.	I cannot take comfort when she has none.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.	Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.	I cannot betray my bride.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.	Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.	I don't think that.
You and I will guard the fire.	What else is left for a man without friends.
Once is enough, thank you.	He saved our lives.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!	I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.	At the gallop!
We could reach it on fire-mares.	Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
Go, join them.	What kind of friend do you think I am?
Go. I command you.	Yes, my lord.
You've eaten nothing.	We must try to get horses.
Hand over your dinner.	A flicker of talent.
I'm not hungry.	Not sleepy, either?
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.	Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
When did you last sleep, boy?	I'm all right.
And where do you lead, boy?	To the place where Death lives.
To the place where Death lives.	It should be an interesting journey, then.
It should be an interesting journey, then.	That I promise you.
That I promise you.	I compel no man to follow me on this journey.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.	How did you know I had sons?
Hah! You don't know me, boy.	I know you.
My heart stays here.	And mine goes with you.
A venison pie as big as a house.	A small house.
Where are you going?	We'll meet you at the inn.
We'll meet you at the inn.	Can't I come, too?
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.	Would you settle for a boar?
Would you desert your friends?	No, no. I'm with you, boy.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?	I don't think it's working.
I'd wish for a puppy.	One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?	I only want one.
I only want one.	A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.	Look at its insides.
Oh, my poor stew!	Oh, my poor stomach.
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!	Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.	And do you think I live on air?
And do you think I live on air?	We have plenty of hares.
We have plenty of hares.	Food for crows.
Put me down, you lout!	You had better manners as a pig.
They'll trample him to death!	No. He will master the leader.
He didn't join them. They joined him.	And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?	He is the King.
He will come for me.	He will not come. You will be my queen.
It's a lie!	These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.	He will not!
He will not!	Then he will die!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.	A match for your son, I think.
A match for your son, I think.	A fine match.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!	That I am, my lady.
You were attacked in the forest?	Yes. We lost five.
Yes. We lost five.	You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
Can you see?	Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.	Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?	The new King.
The new King.	With an old voice?
With an old voice?	You know the voice.
It is the time.	I will seek the Fortress for you.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.	It is not necessary. They will not follow.
Few have survived it.	Fewer will survive them.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.	The Widow of the Web?
She has the power of vision.	She has the power to kill.
Her name is Death.	She had another name once.
Knowledge I wouldn't want.	No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
I cannot stop the sand.	You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.	You will come with me.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?	Why must you know?
Why must you know?	There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
Do not try your trickery on me!	It is no trickery.
It is no trickery.	Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.	It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.	I was beautiful then.
I was beautiful then.	The most beautiful woman in the world.
The most beautiful woman in the world.	But you would not stay with me.
She was not as beautiful.	No, she was not as beautiful.
No, she was not as beautiful.	She bore you many children?
She bore you many children?	We had no children.
We had no children.	You had a son.
You had a son.	You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.	You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.	Where is he? My son.
Give me his name, I will mail him.	OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Yeah... How do you know it?	...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
What's that man's name?	Why do you want to know?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?	No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.	...Good...  But what's special in him?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?	...Not at all.
How shall we get out now, Leon?	Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
I don't know... Five minutes.	Good! Snipers can't be in position.
What do you do, with the money you earn?	Nothing, for the moment.
Nothing, for the moment.	Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
How many girlfriends did you have?	...I don't know.
...I don't know.	Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?	...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!	Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
It's too big.	Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?	Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
When I say I love you.	Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?	...OK.  I love you anyway.
Stop. Everyone is looking.	Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
...I'm going to kiss you.	Mathilda, stop, please!
For musicals?  That's part of the job!	No, you can't go out.
Come on, get down!	You were scared, weren't you?
You were scared, weren't you?	I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
Wow! It's brilliant!	Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
...I got lost, Mister.	Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...	I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Huh? That's smart!	I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Huh, that's good!	Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Can I sit on the stairways now?	Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
...And how much is it?	Ten dollars... A month.
Is he still alive?	Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.	Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Do you recognize him?	...Even his mother wouldn't.
This smells good.	Why am I such an authority?
Why am I such an authority?	Here comes the resume.
What is it?	Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
I have to finish first.	I won't let you die.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.	How serious is it?
What if you don't make it?	I'll make it.
I have new dreams now.	I don't accept that.
What would you like us to do?	Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
How long does this... Mania last?	A couple days to a few months if untreated.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.	You need a ride, Preacher?
Can it kill me?	It can, but it'll have to wait in line.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?	Go to sleep Ellen.
I don't know.	I think it's a different place for each person.
I think it's a different place for each person.	Did you have a dream?
I want children.	You've just decided, is that right?
I thought we both wanted the same things.	I've changed my mind.
I've changed my mind.	You can't change your mind.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.	Please tell me.
Walk with me?	You like to take walks?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?	You're talking to me?
You're talking to me?	Why do you polish it?
What it is -- is the truth.	I don't follow.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.	We can do it together.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?	It's just a regular day.
You thought I sent them?	There was no card.
That's a reasonable assumption.	I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.	Doubts?  About what?
Doubts?  About what?	About my love for her.
Red flags man.	Not our problem.
What's his story?	His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.	Red flag, man.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.	You tell stories?
What was that?	Perhaps there's another route?
Each inch represents 150 miles...	Making the grand total?
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.	Umm, Coalville Utah.
Come on Mr. Parker.	What, come on?
I missed you Kris.	I missed you to Mr. Parker.
What Mr. Parker?	She never ate a slice.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.	So I've been informed.
She knew you loved her.	She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
You're walking to California?	Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.	Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.	You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?	I told you.
You're in pain.	I need your help.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?	Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
There are a lot of people worried about you.	Where am I?
Where am I?	In a hospital.
In a hospital.	Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Is it a boy or a girl?	Oh, that's not mine.
What's your shoe size?	What?  Who are you?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.	What do you mean?
I really want that watch.	This isn't right.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.	What do you want?
What do you want?	What are my choices?
What are my choices?	Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
What do you think I should get?	Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
There are limits.	Yes... I guess I knew that.
I like it here with you.	Let's stay for a while.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.	Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.	Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Shall we go away for a couple of days?	Yeah... I'd like that.
Yes... I'll give you that.	Thank you, Sera.
Thank you, Sera.	Do you want me not to go tonight?
Do you want me not to go tonight?	No... we already talked about that.
What was that all about?	Can we just forget it?
Can we just forget it?	I don't understand any of that.
I don't understand any of that.	Can we just ignore it?
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.	Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.	What do you mean?
Don't you like me, Ben?	Don't be silly?
Sera you are crazy.	So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.	Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.	Thank you. What time is it?
Thank you. What time is it?	Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
This is the home of an angel.	You OK out there?
You OK out there?	Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
If I was I'm sorry.	No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?	Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
Do you want to fuck now?	Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Want a drink? I'm having one.	A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.	No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
Sarah -- with an H?	No -- S.E.R.A.
Are you working?	Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
How much, do you think?	I don't know. I'll find out though.
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.	Where are you staying?
Where are you staying?	Right here at the hotel. Why?
Right here at the hotel. Why?	Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Yuri... are you...	Sera... please go.
It is, after all, Sera, my money.	Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Where have you been staying?	With an old friend.
You have been lonely?	I am lonely, Yuri.
You have been lonely?	I've been all right.
I've been all right.	I will keep you safe. We are both older.
But it's a top three school --	I have a 4.0.
Were you with another man?	Go to hell.
Go to hell.	I'll take that as a no.
I'll take that as a no.	Are we done for today?
Are we done for today?	I believe we are.
I can't tell you.	You understand you're on trial for murder?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?	He's an ass that's gonna try.
He's an ass that's gonna try.	He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?	That's not what's important.
What's going on?	Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
It's so shameful...	Whatever it is -- it could save you.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.	That's just it -- it would ruin me!
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.	Who could better understand than me?
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.	I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.	He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.	Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?	His dead body with a bullet in it.
Did you hear a shot fired?	No. I was in the shower.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?	No, she'd stashed it by then.
You're not going up there.	Yes, I am.
You're hitting on me?	You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.	So everything you just said --
So everything you just said --	I'm a man who knows what I want.
Did you get it?	Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.	That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Was she carrying a weapon?	No, she was crying her eyes out.
-- his life?	I don't know.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?	I think so...
I think so...	How about --
I'm so happy for you!	How'd it go at the trial?
God, that felt great!	Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.	Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?	She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.	Is she as pretty as you?
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.	Licensed attorney or family member?
Licensed attorney or family member?	Uh -- family.
You're pawning The Rock?!	Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
I'm a bitch.	Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.	And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.	Yes, he is.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.	I know. He has it sent out.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.	I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
Our group is full.	Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.	You know her?
We still love you. Sisters forever!	Thank you. I love you, too.
Someone missed you.	Is he the only one?
Is he the only one?	What do you think?
Up for a celebration dinner?	Are you asking me on a date?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.	So Friday at eight?
Oh, my God!	Oh, my God!!
Back up. How do you know he's gay?	Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
You really think I'm attractive?	For a butt-head? Yes.
Projecting joy is not my job.	Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!	Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
And you know this for a fact?	Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?	We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?	No, she can't move for an hour.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.	How do you figure?
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.	Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --	Aside from that.
Aside from that.	She's completely untrustworthy.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.	But maybe it's not what you think.
But maybe it's not what you think.	But maybe it is --
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?	My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
You have Stromwell.	Did she do that to you, too?
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!	What, like on va-kay?
Oh, he is so over on this campus.	I just don't understand what went wrong --
No -- it's just -- not me.	I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
You don't really believe she's innocent?	Of course, I do!
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.	Maybe she found him like that.
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?	I don't know --
I don't know --	You should. Do you have a resume?
Yes? Ms. Woods?	I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
Class schedule, map, book list.	Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?	Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
In court. On opposing sides.	Are you serious?
Are you serious?	Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
Wow. You're a walking felony.	Thank you. Having fun?
Thank you. Having fun?	Now I am.
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?	Uh -- sure.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?	No, silly. I go here.
No, silly. I go here.	You go where?
You go where?	Harvard. Law school.
Harvard. Law school.	You got into Harvard Law?
You got into Harvard Law?	What, like it's that hard?
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.	I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?	That's not entirely --
That's not entirely --	Then what? My boobs are too big?
Then what? My boobs are too big?	Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
I completely agree.	That's why I think it's time for us to --
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.	And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.	Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?	Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
There he is!	Pull up next to him!
Is it a Kappa?	It's not a Theta --
Fire moat... why do that?	Purely a precaution...
You go?  Not watch fun?	I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Then we smash 'em?	Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
You go to lady now?	To finish last evening's delightful work.
We watch... good fun...	Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
Might we watch, too?	Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
You're a beast!	Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.	What do you want from me?
God protect me.	Not from me, surely...
Not from me, surely...	You... you're a beast!
And you... are you not also afraid?	I am afraid of nothing.
I am afraid of nothing.	Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Like some vile toadstool.	I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.	Do you feed on mice and rats?
Why have you brought me here?	To be my bride, of course.
To be my bride, of course.	I'd soon die.
My generosity is not so large as that.	What do you want with me?
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.	But I'm hideous!
I didn't know... I --	What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
You come stealee tleasoo?	Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
You come stealee tleasoo?	Oh no... Don't you understand?
By the pond.  She was teasing me.	Go on... go on...
A good day for singing...	I've not heard a note out of you.
I've not heard a note out of you.	Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.	Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --	Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.	He'll not escape me.
He'll not escape me.	You're on your own... like a true champion.
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!	Never show mercy!
Never show mercy!	I could have struck off his head just now!
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...	Don't get too far!
Sunlight, you say?	Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!	Mean you to seek him out below?
Mean you to seek him out below?	I'm not afraid of the dark.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.	The wound is mortal.
It doesn't matter.	Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.	... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.	Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.	Aye.  We're good as inside.
Aye.  We're good as inside.	It's what we'll find there worries me.
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?	Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.	Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
There isn't much time!	Been telling you that all along, lad.
Been telling you that all along, lad.	What magic have we on our side?
Will you chance a miss?	There must be some way to get it up there.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...	We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.	Why not mine the damned walls?
Give in to despair and all is lost.	It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.	There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...	The chill is worse this night.
Can we trust him?	No... but what choice have we?
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!	Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.	I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...	We'll never find the Baron's castle.
We'll find it.	Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.	Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.	Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.	We'll trust in faith, Gump.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.	Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
What make ye of that, Jack?	It bodes evil.
I should hope not!	Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.	Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
My God!  Look!	Something the matter?
Nice piece of work.	Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.	Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.	I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Worse than the battlefield.	What know you of fields of war?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.	The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.	Aye!  That too.
Aye!  That too.	You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.	I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Pregnant, is she?	It would appear so.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.	Better we eat him than the other way round.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.	You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
And who might that be?	No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.	If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
But... but, why?	Big question that, lad.  Why what?
You be our guest, Jack.	I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
And if I cannot?	Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
Aye... my Lord...	Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!	They've fired the moat!
Well done, lad.	Three cheers for our champion.
We seek to undo the curse.	Gonna make ogre-stew!
You see!  You see!	These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Barely living, from the looks of it.	No, no, no... this is different!
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.	Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
What's the matter?	Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Pinching?  Where?	Everywhere!  Ow!
Everywhere!  Ow!	I can't see a thing.
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?	Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Lili... I love you!	And I love you, my husband.
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?	Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.	You're teasing still.
No!  I won't let it happen...	You've freed me, Jack...
That's why he goes masked during the day...	So, he's hiding in the dark...
So, he's hiding in the dark...	In the dark... where I join him...
I thought you were dead... I --	I was bewitched... it's better this way...
I was bewitched... it's better this way...	They told me you were dead.
What have I done?	Only what's right...
Lili!  No!	Jack... Forgive me...
Tis not fit for a princess.	Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?	I have no wife.
I have no wife.	Then, perchance you'll me.
Then, perchance you'll me.	If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.	Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.	Tis the truth.
My lady mocks me.	Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
I don't want it on me.	Its powers are strong.
Its powers are strong.	I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
They tricked you.	My own father...
My own father...	How bad was the unicorn's wound?
He did run?	Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Where are you going?	To fetch your napkin.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.	They rival the angels of paradise.
I'm not its master.	The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.	Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.	Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.	All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
But you did... you did!	I may have said perhaps...
These for me?	If you like.
Step lively now!	His feet shall never cross my lips.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.	You'll visit again?
You'll visit again?	As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
Ask away, sweet man.	What became of the princess?
What became of the princess?	Princess?  I know of no princess.
Dead, dead, dead.	I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.	Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Heading north still?	True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Be fair, Oona.	You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...	You... you... you mortal you!
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.	A faerie's love makes anything possible.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.	I'm promised to another!
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.	Do I not please you, Jack?
Do I not please you, Jack?	In every way.
In every way.	And am I not fair?
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?	That was in jest.
That was in jest.	Jest with me then.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.	You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.	Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
What care the bones when the soul is free?	Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Praise be to God.	Small miracles better than no miracles...
I'm in your debt, Screwball.	Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
What's she doing?	I think she's about to foal.
You're with us in battle.	May God protect you.
Uhm... fine work.	Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.	You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
How came you by this blade?	I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.	You've been inside?
You've been inside?	In a dream.
Can you show us the way?	To Castle Couer de Noir?
Is he a friend, then?	Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...	I'm sending you back to Hell!
What are you doing?	I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
When does George get to come see his house?	It's so beautiful.
He's not there.	He's here.  Check the bathroom.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.	I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
And video games after!	"Home after.  Will you come in and say ""hi""?"
Did you know him before you knew Dad?	Since seventh grade.
Are you going to see Sam again?	I thought I might stop by.
He hasn't called?	Who are you?
So put your plans of my room in the trash.	I don't think Dad wants you home.
What's that for?	Mom said I should.
I'm going to bed.	Has he eaten anything at all?
Why?  What do you mean?	Uh...using Josh like that.
What are you doing up so early?	I couldn't sleep last night.
I couldn't sleep last night.	I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
I couldn't get it to go down.	And why was the alarm on?
And why was the alarm on?	Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.	You'd better call and cancel.
You'd better call and cancel.	Oh God, we don't want the police!
It's not what I was expecting.	What did you think it would be?
What did you think it would be?	I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
My mother would die.	Let's shut up and not kill her.
You have to ask like that?	I want you to try something with me, okay?
You're a good girl.	I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
I'm living here while I build another house.	Is that legal?
He seems lonely.	Are you his friend?
Where are you?!	Floating to Catalina.
You'd hate him for the trick.	Not if what he left me was real.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?	Are you afraid of heights?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.	I thought I was helping you.
I thought I was helping you.	It would help me if I could kiss you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.	No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?	Okay.  I guess.
Are you sure you're totally into guys?	What are you talking about?
What's the point of this?	Does everything have to have a point?
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.	I'm coming in.
I'm coming in.	I don't want you to!
I don't want you to!	We're not gonna do anything.
We're not gonna do anything.	Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so stupid?	Why are you so uptight?
He's a freak.	You look better without make-up.
You look better without make-up.	I can't even take a shower here.
I might not stay, anyway.	I'll get your back.
I'll get your back.	No.  That's okay.
You should stay.	I don't know.
I don't know.	Where's your dad?
Where's your dad?	He jumped into the ocean.
He jumped into the ocean.	"Tell him I said ""hi""."
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.	Your dad's really gonna build his house?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
He won't leave my room.	Will he talk to me?
Why is that?	Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.	He's at work while I'm here.
He's at work while I'm here.	I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.	Well, he doesn't need to worry.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.	He's got a standing invitation.
Are you guys' friends?	We've known each other since grade school.
And of course the Beck's, with the...	It could have been a squirt gun.
It could have been a squirt gun.	You've been good this week.
It's thirty feet.	Well, if it is, we have a problem.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?	If that's what it takes.
I hate to ask about a window.	I flushed it down the toilet.
And if I enclosed it?	An exhaust system or a window is code.
Well, it's the least I can do.	Yes, it is.
I've got one favor to ask.	What can I do for you, George?
Well, I feel better about this now.	Good.  I was hoping for that.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.	I hate this job.
I hate this job.	What are you talking about?  You love your job.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.	From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
I've been here twenty years.	Maybe that's too long.
Right...she married...what was he?	He buys and sells the world.
I'm good, thanks.	What are you on?
Is Alyssa here?	It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
You're here early today.	We're getting out of the ground today.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.	Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
Thanks for the shower.	I want you both to stay.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.	Not a shower.
Is Alyssa home?	She's out with a friend.
She's out with a friend.	Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?	She didn't really say.
I forgot where I put my keys.	And you thought they might be under her dress?
This has got to stop!	He escaped.  He's going back in.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.	George, this is the third time.
George, this is the third time.	The plumber's due out on Friday.
The plumber's due out on Friday.	You'll have to explain that to the police.
You'll have to explain that to the police.	You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.	I did warn you.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.	I don't know.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.	I still don't know what that means.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.	I still don't know what that means.
She seemed upset.	What's wrong with your back?
I loved him too much.	After everything he did to you and your mom?
To hide a black eye.	Why wouldn't she leave?
I wish you had told me then.	I'm telling you now.
I'm telling you now.	I gave up on you.
What would you be doing now?	Getting high, I guess.
Getting high, I guess.	If I asked you to stop, would you?
If I asked you to stop, would you?	I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.	I'm proud of you, Sam.
I know the feeling.	How do you become something you're not?
How do you become something you're not?	What would you like to be?
What would you like to be?	What I'm not.
What I'm not.	What are you now?
That's not true.	See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.	I know parts of who you are.
I know parts of who you are.	What do you know about me?
I took some of your Vicodin.	I know.  Why?
I know.  Why?	I like how it feels not to feel.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.	You're too fucking late.
You're too fucking late.	The gloves on the table are for you.
The gloves on the table are for you.	You can't make me do a thing.
You can't make me do a thing.	Sit down for a second.
Where is it?	A friend of yours is here.
A friend of yours is here.	Did you got through my pants?
Did you got through my pants?	I might have a solution.
Where are you going?	I don't know.
I don't know.	When are you going to be back?
When are you going to be back?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Well, until you know, you can't go.
No one would blame me if I left!	I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.	I'm not doing it!
I'm not doing it!	It'll be fine.
I don't know.	I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.	You'll have money when you work.
You'll have money when you work.	You're so predictable.
I hate turkey.	No you don't.
What are you doing?!	I warned you yesterday.
I warned you yesterday.	Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
Are you totally insane?!	I almost saw Catalina.
I'm not going!	You don't have a choice.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.	You'll know me by the time we're through.
You'll know me by the time we're through.	I'm not going!
I'm not going!	I'll get your bag.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?	No I'm not!
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.	To check up on me?
To check up on me?	I'll be around to check up on you.
I'll be around to check up on you.	Why would you be there?
Why would you be there?	Because I live there.
Because I live there.	You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
Good for you.	I haven't been touched in years.
Can you build a house in four months?	I can die trying.
What kind of house?	You know what mortise and tenon is?
What would you do?	I'd build a house.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.	Good for you.
I need you to do me a favor.	God, you look like crap, George.
God, you look like crap, George.	I want you to find someone for me.
Ah!  Oh....	I know there's an explanation.
Thanks for telling me.	At least your father tried, George.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.	Left you this place.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?	Oh.  Sorry.
She needs to be alone, I think.	Because Dad left?
Because Dad left?	She's a little sad, is all.
She's a little sad, is all.	I don't even care if he ever comes back.
I better get the kids home.	Not a perfect day.
Are you going to kiss me?	It's not my back that's killing me.
I could die.	So could I.
Is your back still killing you?	I didn't think you'd come today.
No.  Mostly me.	Peter left me yesterday.
What did he say?	'I'll be in the bedroom.'
Let's not do this, okay?	I need to know.
You bit my finger.	If I weren't married?
That was the truth.	You've never said that before.
It sounded like a pick-up line.	I can't pick you up.
I thought we were helping.	I can hire workers to help me.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.	No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.	Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
I smiled at him.	Watch out for the smile, boys.
It's been a while.	This was my very first slow dance.
Do you need help?	I think so.
I'll find something that won't kill them.	Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.	You're a good mother.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.	My stupid back.
With your hands or your tongue?	You're not well.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.	Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
Go in there and lick his attitude.	The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
It's not breakfast yet.	I dreamed about your house last night.
I dreamed about your house last night.	Finished or unfinished?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?	That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.	Oh...with his ear infection!
I used to live here.	But you hated four out of the five you did.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.	Well, for later then.
I don't have a phone.	I drove over and you were gone.
I drove over and you were gone.	I can't leave the house?
I can't leave the house?	Last time you were gone for a week!
No.  I was going to let you do that.	He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.	Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.	One of you would end up dead.
One of you would end up dead.	At least we'll have a house to show for it.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.	Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.	I want him with me.
I want him with me.	No, you don't.  Trust me.
I need to talk to you.	Why would they tow your truck?
Why would they tow your truck?	I was parked in day parking.
I was parked in day parking.	Why call me?
I love those doors.	Where will you live?
When's school over?	Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.	I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.	He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.	Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
A blueprint spool.	Where have you been for a week?!
Where have you been for a week?!	Four days.  I left to think.
Four days.  I left to think.	What did you do with your dog?
What did you do with your dog?	Kurt's been feeding him.
Kurt's been feeding him.	But you can't call me while you think?
He never answers.	Why does he have a lock on his door?
What are you doing?	He doesn't answer.
Lock the door behind you.	Where is he?
Where is he?	Where he always is.
You should lock your doors.	Ring the bell before you try the door.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.	I could use the money.
What's your deal with Alyssa?	Don't even...I'm there.
Don't even...I'm there.	I wasn't sure.
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.	Does Alyssa know?
You got any weed?	You got the money?
Where are the kids?	Sam took them to a movie.
Sam took them to a movie.	I'll be in the bedroom.
You never really trusted me.	You live a fabulous life, Robin.
I never asked for more.	That's the problem.
That's the problem.	Please don't leave me.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?	What are you doing home?
I can't go right now.	You can't go because of Sam?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.	Sooner than the Fall.
The biggest waste of time since television.	Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
To shave your chest?	We should take a vacation.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.	I'll make you something.
His father is a man.	A man he respects.
You don't look like you.	Either do you.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.	Are you wearing eye shadow?
You got a dog?	It's not ours.  It's George's.
You could keep it and rent it out?	This is what he wants.
The door was open.	I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know what I'm doing.	I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
Can you stay for dinner?	Depends on what I'd give up on.
What are you doing in my room?	I didn't go in your room.
Go tell your father we're eating.	Dad's home, already?
Dad's home, already?	In the bedroom.
Nothing R, okay?	Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Adam, that's not true!	Yes, it is.
I brought a few of my own.	Someone stop her!
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?	Can we really help build a house?
All day again?	Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
What did you say?	Dad said it first.
A night in the hole?	Better make it a week.
Is Mae Rose okay?	She's doing just fine.
She's doing just fine.	And the baby?
And the baby?	He's a big one.
He's a big one.	It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.	Not for me, it ain't.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.	I'm talking about a haircut.
I'm talking about a haircut.	Cost you a pair of nylons.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?	Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.	Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.	There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.	Is Spanky here?
She always said that if you were on the outside...	But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Take care of me?	You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
She's alright, isn't she?	Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
I got it... boss.	He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.	But I'm having a good time...
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.	You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?	Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.	Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
Can't you remember your own name?	"I know it begins with a ""C""..."
I've never seen you in here before.	That's because I've never been here before.
That's because I've never been here before.	I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
I know you're not talking to me...	I'm sorry, he's on medication...
Yeah? You and what army?	Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.	Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?	Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.	You didn't get ketchup?
You didn't get ketchup?	Gimme that damn thing.
I can't eat this.	Why the hell not?
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?	He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
I can't do it.	That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.	What'd you say?
What'd you say?	I said you're soft.
No, I'm gonna kill him --	No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
Damn, it was getting hot in there.	What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
Go where, Ray?	Back to New York for starters.
Don't make me take them away from you.	Hey, there's Wilkins!
What the hell are you doing?	Don't touch that car.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.	That was five years ago.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.	Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
Well, if that's the way it is...	That's the way it is.
That's the way it is.	Then I have nothing left to say to you.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.	Make 'em throw strikes.
It's a pardon from the governor.	Let me see that.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.	We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.	What am I gonna eat?
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?	I don't know. Who do you want?
I don't know. Who do you want?	Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.	You drew this?!
Absolutely. The map is very clear.	Let me take a look at that map.
What'd you say?	I said you're soft.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?	What do you want, Claude?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?	You still got that map?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.	Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.	I'm sure it don't.
This fork is filthy.	The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.	Winston. His name's Winston.
Winston. His name's Winston.	Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
It ain't here.	What ain't there?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.	Here I am.
Here I am.	Guess we better get going, huh?
Guess we better get going, huh?	Still got that ten dollars?
So you made a generous contribution.	What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
You lost all our money in a card game?	He even got my daddy's watch.
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?	What gave you that idea?
Alright. You want some pie?	Yeah, I want some pie.
I said you're soft.	Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
How would I get a loan, anyway?	You need collateral.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?	My daddy gave me this watch.
My daddy gave me this watch.	Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
A loan officer?	That's right, a loan officer.
Where they taking us, anyway?	Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Don't I know you?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	Sure I do. What's your name again?
You went to Monroe?	That's right! Good old Monroe...
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.	I try to moisturize regularly.
How you doin'?	I'm all right.
I'm all right.	You ever done time before?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!	Made just for you, Cookie.
Made just for you, Cookie.	How about some steak sauce?
How about some steak sauce?	No problem. Oh, boy!
You got your own nightclub?	Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
All in, boss!	Move it out.
Move it out.	Movin' it out, boss.
Why ain't his pick swinging?	Why ain't that pick swinging?
Where am I at, man?	C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.	What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
Hey, the dude's holdin'.	Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
Just like Elvis.	Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
Wait for the firemen!	It'll be too late.
It'll be too late.	You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Is everyone here?	Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.	Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
I prefer bourbon.	I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.	Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.	Like you shot Winston Hancock?
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?	Something like that, yes.
Something like that, yes.	She give you that scar, too?
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.	Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?	You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.	Greenville, that the nearest town?
What's the Boom Boom Room?	That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
What's your name?	Me? Willie Long.
Me? Willie Long.	What are you in for, Willie?
What are you in for, Willie?	That's a long story...
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.	You found him.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?	Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Let her go.	I hear a train coming. Drink.
You shouldn't have come here.	Please, get out of my mind!
All right. Let me out.	You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
We could create our own hell there.	You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
...their damned souls will be ours.	It's our time, brother.
That's what I thought!	Could you concentrate for five seconds?
Could you concentrate for five seconds?	I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?	What do you think about... Earth?
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.	Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
And he's dead serious.	It's just such a slap in the face.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.	I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Urr... uggg... errr...	I'm calling you out, brother...
And give you a good buzz.	Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.	Uh. No it won't?
All these good people have totally been led astray.	Show him Central Park.
I'll call her later.	You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
How did you see me?	We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
How come you're not older?	Angels don't get any older, son.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.	My mom wasn't a goat?
My mom wasn't a goat?	Try an angel.
Where is he? He's late.	He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
This is baloney!	"He superimposed your head onto ""Scarface."""
I didn't murder anybody	Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.	The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.	What can I do about it?
Go get a soda out of the fridge.	But those are my roommate's sodas...
So far, so good. Now what?	Put it in your mouth.
Makin' friends already.	It's freezing up here, Beefy.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?	Everything's fine, pop.
Everything's fine, pop.	Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.	Please, pop, just go back to your room.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.	C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Check one-two. Check one-two.	Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
You came through, Nicky.	I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
No. This can't be happening.	Son, just do your best.
So go get 'em, Dad!	I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
You're a good devil, Dad.	And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?	Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.	I was just playing with you.
Coulda been much worse.	That's what I'm thinkin'...
You know, I was the one who created Hell.	I know, your wickedness.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.	Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...	I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Looking for the chief.	We know where to find Nicky.
You sure you're down with this?	Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Look who's back from the dead.	Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?	The Dark Prince is here.
Should we wake him up?	Yeah. You do it.
What's with that guy?	Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Come on. One more time.	Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...	So I followed him...
So I followed him...	You followed him?
Yes, great movie...	I was DeNiro!
You gotta kill yourself.	I'll just go to Heaven.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!	Dude, it's us. Let us in.
You got the wrong window again, man.	Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.	Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.	I don't need luck. I'm good.
I love you.	I love you.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?	From my dad's side of the family.
Don't do it.	I have to, Valerie.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.	Okay, I do. Get back up here.
"What do you mean, ""possessed?"""	Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
What are you doing?	I think I'm floating.
I think I'm floating.	Why would you be floating?
Why would you be floating?	I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.	What was that?
It's freezing my hands.	It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?	If you want to.
My dad's an optometrist.	My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.	I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
That just hurt a lot.	I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
It looks like the work of a brother...	A black guy?
A black guy?	If it's Cassius, yes.
Why is that funny?	I don't know.
I don't know.	And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
See something you like, my man?	Yes. I would like my flask back.
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!	No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
That's better.  How do you want us?	Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.	It'll be all right...
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.	Where do you send them?
Where do you send them?	You're a beautiful pair.
Where do you think we came from?	From? From? From?
How do you think we got here??!!	You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?	Anything to eat?
Do you have anything special in mind?	I don't care... Just get it over with.
I don't care... Just get it over with.	Hurry... hurry... hurry.
Your own work?	And I did it myself right on there.
Why did you do that??!!	I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...	Why did you do that???!!!
What's going on, Logan?!	It has nothing to do with you.
What the hell took you so long?	Did you ever see anybody renew?
I'm fine...  See you...	At Carousel tonight?
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.	You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Who invited you?	I'm in my party mood.
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.	Only a few? You're just not trying.
You missed something special.	Well... you can't have them all.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?	Not in my time...
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.	No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
What's your name?	I'm Mary 2.
I'm Mary 2.	Where do you live, Mary?
Why aren't you in Nursery?	I'm very smart.
I'm very smart.	When do you go up?
When do you go up?	I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
There's a Sanctuary... there is!	You want there to be one... that doesn't...
You know, Jessica.	...But I still have the choice...?
What does it mean?	The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.	Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
It all seemed to make sense until Box.	Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?	I doubt it.
I doubt it.	Don't ever let go.
I hate outside! I hate it!	We'll be all right...  We will...
It doesn't make any difference anymore.	You're really one of us now, aren't you?
How do we know this is the right way?	It's the only way.
Will you take me with you?	Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
They won't believe us.	I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.	They won't listen.
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.	Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...	But what is this -- why?
They're like beasts. Wild.	Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
Some people say children need human mothering.	Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.	You're not going, are you?
If you did know, you'd tell me.	Of course --
Of course --	If you trusted me, you'd know.
If you trusted me, you'd know.	We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
I wish I could help you.	Maybe you'll think of something...
Maybe you'll think of something...	I wish I knew what you think I know.
Are you here to help me?	What do you need?
Where did you get that?	A Runner gave it to me.
A Runner gave it to me.	And then you killed him, right?
And then you killed him, right?	I let him go... believe me.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...	Please? What friends?
Please? What friends?	I don't have much time.
I don't have much time.	I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...	And I never heard of Sanctuary.
Why show me?	I'm going to run.
I'm going to run.	Why tell me?
Why tell me?	You know something.
You know something.	About running, dying what?
About running, dying what?	Both... running's what I'm interested in.
It's different now. Help me.	How can I?
I couldn't get you out of my mind.	I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
You could have called me yourself.	But I wasn't sure you'd come.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.	Here I am.  Shall I come in?
I didn't say that I would run... I just...	Are you a 5 or a 6?
Are you a 5 or a 6?	Six. I go red next year.
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.	Not about that.
I'm afraid to tell you.	I'm not armed.  Well?
I'm not armed.  Well?	Why is it wrong to run?
I suppose. But what if you want to live?	So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
No.  Just no.	You prefer women?
Yes... probably he was renewed?	He was killed.
He was killed.	Killed? Why do you use that word?
Killed? Why do you use that word?	Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.	You felt sad. What's your name?
But you put yourself on the circuit!	I thought I had to do something.
Come with us.	Where are you going?
I'll make the arrangements.	At least it's over...
What belongs to the people?	All this. All of it.
What kind of jewel is this?	I don't know.
Are you sure?	Mother and Father said so... you know?
Can you make it back?	Oh my... I'll try.
Stay? They lived together all their years?	Oh, yes... I think...
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?	More... many more.
More... many more.	And all alive you say?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?	No, no, no
No, no, no	Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?	Never, never, ever. Nothing.
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?	No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Where are they?	Dead... they're dead... and buried.
But there may be a few around somewhere.	What makes you think so?
What makes you think so?	My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?	Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
How did you get here?	I have always been here...
I have always been here...	Are there any other humans?
How long have you been living here?	For as long as I can remember.
For as long as I can remember.	What kind of place is this?
What kind of place is this?	Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.	Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.	Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
Well? How do you like it?	I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --	Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
I'm, okay... You okay?	Sure, I'm okay.
You want somethin'?	No, I'm okay.
"Just goin' up'ta ""Tops""... Maybe the ""Ten Pin""."	"Sheila'll be at ""Tops""."
"Sheila'll be at ""Tops""."	Sure, what's wrong with that?
You're not contagious are you?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	Good... You up for a drive?
I like to remember things my own way.	What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?	How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
You're a musician?	Yes, I thought my wife...
Do you own a video camera?	No. Fred hates them.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.	You know what I think?
You know what I think?	What's that, Ed?
What's that, Ed?	There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
What a fuckin' job.	His or ours?
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?	Or not so recently?
We'll keep a watch on the house.	As best we can.
As best we can.	If anything else happens, you'll call us.
Might be a good time to try using it again.	Anybody else have a key to the house.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.	Right... This just glided along.
Where's the bathroom?	Up the stairs - down the hall.
You all right?	We killed him.
We killed him.	You killed him.
Why are ya goin' so early?	'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.	What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.	Yeah. Call him.
You liked it.	If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
You like it?	No, honey... It was part of the deal.
He works for Mr. Eddy.	What's he do?
What's he do?	He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
Have you partied with him?	I used to.
He'll kill us.	Are you positive he knows?
Are you positive he knows?	I'm not positive... but... he knows.
I'm not positive... but... he knows.	So what do we do?
So what do we do?	I don't know.
I don't know.	We should stop seeing each other.
Can I call you?	Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
I was here yesterday.	Yeah, I remember.
Yeah, I remember.	How would you like to take me to dinner?
How would you like to take me to dinner?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
I don't. I don't know him.	Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
Yes, I believe so.	But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?	Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Never saw him before in my life.	Did you tell the police this?
You don't look so good.	I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?	The police called us.
The police called us.	Yeah? what did they want?
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.	Do ya good.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?	What night is that?
What night is that?	The night before you showed up in the slammer...
His condition? What do you mean?	His physical condition.
His physical condition.	Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
We saw you that night, Pete.	You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Out in back.	You talk to him?
You talk to him?	No... Here he comes.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.	Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
You just gonna let him go?	We'll get a tail put on him.
One of the guards must have leaked it.	What's the word on the street?
Where is he now?	He's in the infirmary, being examined.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.	Did you ask him who he is?

Agatha, you're never going back there.	I am going back.  I see myself there.
No.  Follow him.	He'll turn around.
Drop some money.	Forget that guy --
Forget that guy --	Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?	Because I found out about her...
-- but he didn't.	Then who was he?
Then who was he?	Just some guy... they found.
Just some guy... they found.	Found?  Where?
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.	I can't even stand up --
I put you away --	Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.	You made those tapes...
You made those tapes...	They were performance pieces.
They were performance pieces.	You set your patients on fire!
You don't remember me, do you?	We know each other?
That's not much.	It's all I could safely move.
And replace them with new ones.	I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Hence the expression...	... Graveyard shift.
... Graveyard shift.	"Not to mention, ""Saved by the bell""."
You the only sentry?	I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
That's an old one.  One of our first.	This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.	For that, we have to go for a ride.
John.  Please.  Listen to me --	I'm not getting halo'd.
I'm not getting halo'd.	You can't run --
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.	Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?	Somebody named Leo Crow.
Somebody named Leo Crow.	And who the hell is that?
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!	Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?	Can you fake the cerebral output?
I go running down there.	In the middle of the night?
I understand.  What's the other thing?	Tuck in your shirt.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --	Don't apologize, John.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?	Hang on, Lamar --
Tell me not to worry, John.	Don't worry, Lamar.
Don't worry, Lamar.	The nation votes this week...
You don't have to do this, Chief.	You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.	You're kidding, that's today?
Confirm with trig and image.	Any ID on the shooter yet?
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.	That was easy.
Yeah?  So?	Now look at him...
Somewhere near the capital?	No maglev system.
We can't grab it...	Run the subscription list...
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.	You gonna tell on me?
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.	"But you call this room the ""temple""."
"But you call this room the ""temple""."	Just a nickname.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.	Really?  You've never been inside?
So I'll be the first one to go in then?	Maybe you didn't hear me.
Maybe you didn't hear me.	If it's a question of authority.
If it's a question of authority.	There's no question.  You don't have any.
There's no question.  You don't have any.	I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
Why did you catch that?	Because it was going to fall.
Just go to the beginning!	Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Wally, listen to me...	Do I know you?  Who are you?
Rufus, play it back...	Uh, I'll try...
What happened?  Where's the rest?	I guess that's all of it.
They don't belong to anybody.	Then take her to Radio Shack.
Are you reading my mind right now?	Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Rufus.  She's a precog.	She's a precog?
I need help with her.	Well, hello there, honey-pie.
Who are you?	I'm your son.  I'm you.
No.  He got tired of pretending.	Oh, Sean --
I forgive you.	Once I even told him I loved him.
Once I even told him I loved him.	I forgive you...
Sean -- you're not real.	You gotta have faith, Dad.
You gotta have faith, Dad.	It's a little late for that.
It's a little late for that.	Wanna hear something funny?
Wanna hear something funny?	What the hell.
Let go of the gun.	You're not gonna kill me...
Tell me, who was it, set this up?	If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.	Who made you do this?
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.	Who said I would?
But you have to.  They said you would.	The precogs were wrong.
The precogs were wrong.	If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
Do you know who I am?	Some -- somebody's father?
Some -- somebody's father?	His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
How do I even know which one has it?	It's always in the more gifted of the three.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.	Which one is that?
If... you have one.	-- and then walk out.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.	Hold that thought.
Hold that thought.	Why should I trust you?
What safe place is that?	The safest place of all.
The system would collapse.	I believe in that system...
I believe in that system...	Do you?  Really?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?	Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Not if I stay away from him.	How can you avoid a man you've never met?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?	So you won't help me?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.	You're talking about the precogs...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.	And how would I know that?
He's dead, Lara.	Oh, God, what did you do?
Oh, God, what did you do?	Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.	Then how did he --
We know why John was tagged.	He also said Crow was a fake.
It's insanity around here.	I thought you were retiring?
You have an emergency call on your private line.	Thank you.  This is Burgess.
How did you get this?	I padded your expense account for the last six months.

There a maid in this hotel?	I don't know, why?
What kind of cop were you before this?	I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?	Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
He's trying to prove his innocence.	He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.	No.  He can't...
It doesn't matter.  He wins.	We can stop him.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?	Because he thinks he's innocent.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.	Yes, I know.
Can't they shut that off?	That's the Red Ball Alarm.
This is Evanna, the team pilot.	Nice to meet you.  Gum?

Good. You've both been working close to the front.	Never this close.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.	They give you copies to burn.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.	You really think we hurt him that bad?
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.	Look at that right eye.
Miss you, Walt.	He said it for us all, Walt.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?	Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
So long, Ho-Jon.	You make a mean martini, kid.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?	I don't drink intoxicants.
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!	What the hell's going on here?
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.	We could steal one of the choppers.
We could steal one of the choppers.	I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
Any time. Whenever we want.	Be right with you.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.	Same here. You can retire my number.
Never heard of him.	Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.	The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
When will he be able to write?	What's he got to write, for God's sake?
What's he got to write, for God's sake?	An application to Androscoggin College.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.	You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.	Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.	Except we forgot one other small thing.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!	We been had.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?	Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?	Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Wait a second...	I can't... couldn't.
I think it's a marvelous letter.	We're a good team.
We're a good team.	We think the same way.
We think the same way.	It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?	Ravenous. What about you?
Ravenous. What about you?	Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...	Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
I have a tent to myself.	People will talk.
I was just asking...	Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
But what about Major Houlihan?	You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.	N-n-no thanks, G-General.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.	I though you said we didn't have a drop.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.	I found a doner.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.	Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.	Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
Is he out?	Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.	No, no, that one.
...But I turned in my knee pads.	Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?	If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
All of them?	That's right. We work well together.
That's right. We work well together.	Major Burns is far from satisfied.
The bastards outconned us.	I think we could still have a chance.
I think we could still have a chance.	If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
You're asking for somebody else?	It happens to be a matter of life and death.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.	You're leaving tomorrow?
You're leaving tomorrow?	In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
You're an attractive man.	You have a certain modest charm yourself.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.	But I'm married.
But I'm married.	Something else we have in common.
Something else we have in common.	Very happily married.
Of course not.	It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.	Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.	No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.	How did you get called that?
It was really nice of you to take me along.	I didn't have much choice.
I didn't have much choice.	You really say the cutest things.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!	Excuse me, Sergeant.
What do you want with those two medical officers?	They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
He's coming to.	Let's get his clothes off quick.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?	Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
In the direction you want to go.	You guys got any black capsules?
No, never in the slightest.	Just in dreams?
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.	Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.	You can cut the bow.
You can cut the bow.	I have not understood what you means.
I have not understood what you means.	That. It's out of the act.
About that chest-cutter...	I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!	We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?	Nope, we're assigned heah.
What's going on? Who started this?	You mean who hit who?
You mean who hit who?	Yes, that's what I mean.

To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.	Stop that, O'Rielly!
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?	I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.	What's that, Henry?
What's that, Henry?	I out-coached that General Hammond.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.	May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.	Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!	John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Can I help you pack?	No, thank you.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?	Uh-huh . . .
Against anything. Just protest.	You got me.
With all of it?	Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.	Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.	He likes you well enough to stick around.
Are you all right?	Yeah, I'm all right.
A third party?	Yes. The John Doe Party.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?	No, no, nothat's your seat.

Who, for instance?	Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
What John Doe?	The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
You made it up.	Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.

There is no letter.	We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!	There is no letter.
Oh, let me go, will you!	Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!

Have you seen him?	I ain't seen him for a week.
He's watching the other door.	Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Had any schooling?	Yeah, a little.
Yeah, a little.	What do you do when you work?
What do you do when you work?	I used to pitch.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Both of 'em?
What do they want?	They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?	Sure. Mostly often.

Oh, just traveling through, huh?	Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.

That's got nothing to do with it!	Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Were you paid for itor weren't you?	Yes! I was paid! But the
What difference does that make?	Did you write itor didn't you?
Did you write itor didn't you?	No, I didn't write it, but
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.	Good night, John.
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.	Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
It's for Ann . . .	Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
That's too bad.	What do you mean, too bad?
What do you mean, too bad?	Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!	I think it must have been a sea- gull.
Out the window! Something just flew by!	I didn't see anything.
Spencer of the Chronicle .	Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
What's the line?	It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.	I'll take half of your action.
Where's the stereo?	Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?	Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
You're my hero.	Dinner's on you.
I don't know.	He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.	Not that we know of.
They're not usually graduate students.	SWAT wants to go in.
SWAT wants to go in.	What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
Who is it?	It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!	What happened, Mike.
What happened, Mike.	You don't want to know.
I hate fucking Springfield.	Is that where you're family lives?
This has nothing to do with Walter.	They want Walter dead!
Am I gettin' the car?	You're gettin' the car.
Where's the car?	I need to get something straight first.
Hold on a second here.	Is there a problem?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?	Being faxed over now.
Anything on Korda so far?	Solis said to keep you clear of this.
It's all there.	Spread it out.
Is that all?	For now that's all.
McCall, you all right?	I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
So what do you want to do?	That's a chance I gotta take.
And what if you can't live with it?	You've got to decide that for yourself.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.	Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
What the fuck is going on.	I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
There's your answer. He's smart.	He's cutting down the visibility.
He's cutting down the visibility.	And doing a very good job of it.
How long you been coming here?	About six years. My partner took me.
About six years. My partner took me.	Is it always like this?

The 6 horse is last.	That's okay. That's his style.
That's okay. That's his style.	To run last?
To run last?	To run late!
I'm just practicing my lying.	Still needs work.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.	Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?	So what do you want?... An autograph.
So what do you want?... An autograph.	I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
I have two words for you... Seek help.	I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
You know why I like the track?	You're a compulsive gambler?
You tell me.	Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
To save lives.	So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
What's the first commandment?	Thou shall have no other God before me.
I'm not good at lying.	Get good at it.
Get good at it.	It's against my nature.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.	So what do I say to this guy?
You think you can learn, McCall?	I think so.
I think I can handle that one.	Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.	Do you really?
Where did you hear that?	Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.	You living together?
You living together?	She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.	Explain how that works.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?	No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
We see each other every couple of months.	Every couple of months, huh?
You got a girlfriend?	Why? You like my ass?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.	I don't really like to drink.
I don't really like to drink.	You have to. It's a tradition.
You have to. It's a tradition.	Well, if I have to, I have to.
How are we gonna get him out of there?	We could fill it with water.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?	They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.	Recruited you from where?
Recruited you from where?	National Marksman Competition.
Furthest point I could find from New York.	You don't like New York?
You'd never been out of New York?	Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.	How did you like Toronto?
How did you like Toronto?	It was okay.
It was okay.	You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
Is there something wrong with that?	I'm not sure.
It rarely has to be done.	I've rarely shot anyone.
I've rarely shot anyone.	SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
You ever been in a hostage situation?	Only at the very end.
Only at the very end.	How do you feel after a shooting.
How do you feel after a shooting.	Like it had to be done.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?	If you say so.
Have you evacuated anyone?	Only that floor.
Only that floor.	Is the hostage injured?
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?	My name's Scott Roper.
I know how you feel, Ray.	You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
You crazy? With all those people around?	Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.	The hell I am!
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.	...the hell are you talking about?
...the hell are you talking about?	I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.	Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.	I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.	Use your imagination.
You like this place?	It's very nice.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?	It's okay. We broke up.
What do you think?	Mmm, needs a little something.
I've been craving that stuff all week.	And it's hard to get.
It's already started.	I was going to catch the last half on TV.
I wanted to get this out of the way.	You got a bet on the game tonight?
You got a bet on the game tonight?	As a matter of fact, I do.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.	What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?	Something I guess I can't have anymore.
You think I didn't need you?	If you did, you never showed it.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.	You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Scott, You can't save everyone.	I've proved that, didn't I?
That a new picture?	About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
Yeah. I'm sorry.	Can I come in?
I'm not drunk. Yet.	Maybe you should be.
Please. I'm begging you.	Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.	I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.	This Greg is really getting in my way.
I worship you.	You worship yourself.
You worship yourself.	Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Stay up there, Girl...	Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...	I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
Are these yours?	Yeah, they are but...
What have you promised them?	Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
I can't do that.	I want to be put on this case.
Who's running it!	Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Repoed this morning.	I'll provide you with transportation.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.	The car is part of the deal.
The car is part of the deal.	What happened to your Trans Am?
You let us worry about that.	Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?	What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
What do you think would be in order?	Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.	Okay, I think I could swing that.
Are you going to make this hard for me?	Depends. What's up?
This is Halden.	Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.	What do you want?
What do you need?	I need to take back what's mine.
How come I can't remember?	Because I took it out of your memory.
But this is impossible.	That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
Who are you?!	Someone who believes in miracles.
Do you believe in miracles?	I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Only up there in the dream they called life.	And down here --
In a computer program.	The new world.
The new world.	It's not real.
You are not a God.	In here I am.
Not my problem.	So wrong --
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.	True.  But why?
You sure he's going to come?	It's his nature.
It's his nature.	But what if he doesn't --
But what if he doesn't --	-- He will.
And what about the reconfiguration?	Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
How long 'till we can eject?	We're going to have to reconfigure.
The woman you're stuck on.	There is no --
There was no need to kill her.	Then where is she?
Then where is she?	Come on Tanner, think this through.
Then you had her killed.	Why would I do that?
Why would I do that?	To hide the evidence.
Not his style.	Katie was digitized.
What is it?	The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.	You've got the keys, send someone in --
You've got the keys, send someone in --	-- Christoph changed the maze.
You're jumping to conclusions.	He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
Won't be time if he gets access --	-- He won't.
But you were with me.	Not you.  A copy.
Not you.  A copy.	What's the difference?
But I don't know anything about programming.	Once they digitized you, they added it.
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.	That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.	Who are you?!
Then how do you know about --	-- You told me.
-- You told me.	What are you talking about?
What brings you inside?	Cleaning up a mess.
Cleaning up a mess.	Some things never change, do they?
Just like that?	Just like that --
What's so funny?	This.  No point to it.
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --	-- Transmit now!

Wow.  Sand.	Now tell me... what do you see?
Is this... food!	They're called squirbs.
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!	There should be a way to open it.
I can hardly walk...	I've never been this sore in my life.
I heard that!	I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.

How was it? I don't recall.	It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.	I'd better go report this...
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	Are you okay??

Let's get away from here.	That's dynamite, Joe!
Joe--drop everything and come with me!	What's the matter?
Why don't you do it yourself?	He's lost complete faith in me--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?	What are you talking about? What difference--?

Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.	How nice. How do you do, Senator?
His first 'whiff'!	Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!	Do I actually *see* this--?

What is it?	It's a thought I had.
It's a thought I had.	Should I open it now?
I was... never satisfied.	Now we're back on track.
Where's your wife, Henry?	Go to hell.
Go to hell.	I didn't hear you.
Why? I'm paying for this.	Not for this. Not me, you're not.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.	You find it distasteful, don't you?

I want to give you something. Will you let me?	Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.

You're early... it's not ready. What happened?	My patient had to leave early.
My patient had to leave early.	Who was that?
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.	Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!	And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
-- you crazy? You can't do this!	Sure I can, Lionel.
What's wrong with her?	Is she a friend of yours?
Got a license?  But no car?	Don't need it.
Don't need it.	I just got my license two weeks ago.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.	That would explain it.
That would explain it.	Can you help Mom?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.	Mother... go away!
What's happening here?	We're going for a walk.
We're going for a walk.	Do you think that's a good idea?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.	Mumford... like the town?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.	Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
Well, look who's here...	Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.	Just who is here, can you tell me?
Just who is here, can you tell me?	Could I see Sofie, please?
Wow. You're something.	Take a hike, Dr. Quack!

What do you mean?	I think you know what I mean.
I think you know what I mean.	No, I really don't.
No, I really don't.	I think you do.
I think you do.	Why don't you tell me?
What'd you want?	There's something I think we need to talk about.
Oh... not a real doctor.	That's right, the fake kind.
You got off easy.	Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?	We're only talking about six weeks.
We're only talking about six weeks.	Will you be here?
...but first, you have to tell me something...	Anything... just ask.
Anything... just ask.	What is your name?
Will you think about it?	I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
...How violated I feel?	You're not the only one...
I guess you saw the show...?	Which show was that?
"Part of it. We were watching ""ER"" until someone called."	You probably got the idea.
Is something wrong, Sofie?	Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
My brother said you were about to fire me.	That's one way to put it.
So whose route is this?	Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.	And he's where?
And he's where?	In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
You like it?	It's all right.
It's all right.	Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.	And this is legitimate therapy?
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing	It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
I can give myself a headache instantly.	Is that like a party trick?
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?	Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.	Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Is this the treatment?	Sorry... I'm done.

Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.	Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Is that the technical description of what I've got?	Is she against you getting help?
Is she against you getting help?	We don't discuss it.
We don't discuss it.	Something's bothering her.
I'm not making any promises.	We'll turn back anytime you want.
We'll turn back anytime you want.	Oh boy... this should be interesting.
I don't know. I barely made it today.	I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
What'd he say?	"He said -- ""Which we already knew!"""
What happened today?	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	Was it something that happened at school?
Was it something that happened at school?	These appointments were not my idea, remember.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.	True. Should we stop them?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.	What do you want me to see?
It's called pro bono.	Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?	It's my bit for the community.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?	Have women found you attractive?

In maybe three or four issues.	Weekly or monthly?
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?	Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.	It's a big part of the show.
I guess that makes sense.	Yes, yes it does...
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?	Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.	This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.	You want my advice? Far out!
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.	See you Thursday... regular time.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.	That'd be Lily.

You were messed up, man.	But look at me now...

This is great!	This is exactly what I wanted.
Can I ask you a personal question?	Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.	Have you thought about getting a wife?

None of the above, thank you.	Then what the hell are you doing here!?
Now go find me a big stick.	In the desert? What for?

Not unless you call me Rick.	Why would I do that?
Why would I do that?	Because that's my name.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.	Who was talking about what?

But he's just a filthy criminal?	Way to go, Evy.
I was mistaken.	You lied to me!
You lied to me!	I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?

Hey,... don't I know you?	Um, well, you see...
She's my sister, actually.	Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Except for one little thing.	And what's that?
I know you did.	I knew you'd know.
I knew you'd know.	I know you knew I'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.	But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
You two timing psychotic bastard.	Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Our guests are waiting.	I'll be down in a jiffy.
I thought you were done?	One last tweak.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?	Fantasizing... about you.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.	Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.

It must have slipped my mind.	Your mind is so slippery.
Hey, do I look like a Man?	Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
Come on, baby!	Do it, big boy!
We could really use some coffee --	And some sandwiches --
Much less go outside.	Then Captain Amazing appeared.
He was the last time I saw him.	When was that?
When was that?	I was eight.
We didn't think this through very well.	My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
So who killed him?	The Disco Boys.
Sounds good to me.	Let's do it.
No one will believe us.	They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
But you're a superhero.	The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
How about... the Savage Six?	The Inscrutable Six?
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.	He was cute though.

Who are you?	I'm the Bowler.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.	Half a Dirty Dozen!
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?	I thought you'd never ask.
Snap out of it!	Get on to yourself!

That boy's got talent.	And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
I got it.	What about Captain Amazing?
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.	They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
They always call the great ones nuts.	And the nuts always call themselves great.
And the nuts always call themselves great.	Are you with me... or against me?
I'd better go.	You're a spy.
I'm not that kind of girl.	Then why are you here?
I thought you'd chickened out on me.	Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Are you an actress?	Just a waitress.
Just a waitress.	You underestimate yourself.
At the Frankenstein Center.	Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Are you nuts? Get out of there!	I'm going inside.
I'm going inside.	What are you talking about?
And what if you get killed?	Then at least I will have died trying, right?

How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?	The Lord will provide.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.	Where's she at?
Them kids is yours?	My flesh and blood!
My flesh and blood!	Where's your Missus?
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.	It's about that John and that Pearl?
What'd you all talk about?	Pearl and John.
Pearl and John.	John and Pearl!
Now who was this?	He never asked me for nothin'.
I been bad!	Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.	You'll whip me!
You'll whip me!	When did I ever?
When did I ever?	This man down at the Drugstore...
What you been up to?	I been out with men.
Oh my god, oh my god...	Get the kit!
How long's this been going on?	Since the murder. She was fine before that.
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!	I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.	Well what you reading it for?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.	And if you can't do that, you sleep.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.	Used to. Not anymore.
Jesus, it's dark in here.	Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Guess I did.	Haven't slept, have you?
What the hell's going on!?	Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?	Because he was scary, that's why.
Because he was scary, that's why.	Who was scary?
It's just a stupid cat.	Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!	Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.	Nan, I --
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.	Just want to talk to him a second.
Decide to take a day off after all?	Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Rod's not a lunatic.	You got a sane explanation for what he did?
How you doing, pal?	Okay. Hi, dad.
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...	Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?	She lived there.
She lived there.	I don't mean her --
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --	I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.	How you know that?
Guess I should'n'a done it.	Just sleep now, Mom.
Give me the key, mother.	I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.	Put that damned thing down!
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.	No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Right home after.	Right home after. See you.
It wasn't that serious...	Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?	Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
Someone else was there.	The door was locked from your side.
I never touched her.	You were screaming like crazy.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?	He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.	We should get her out of here...
Nice to have a fire.	Really. Turn 'er up a little.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.	Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Rod says the sweetest things.	He's nuts about you.
You feel better now, right?	Jungle man fix Jane.
Jungle man fix Jane.	No more fights?
No more fights?	No more fights.
No more fights.	Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
What the hell you doing here?	Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?	Of course. What's that?
What is it, Ninotchka?	It's from Paris.
Well, here are fifty francs.	Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.	Bring me forty-five back.
Thank you, Comrade.	Have you any money?
Tell me... what else did you have?	Well, a hat...
Well, a hat...	What was it like?
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.	An evening gown.
A dress you wear in the evening.	What do you wear in the morning?
You want this?	Just for the honeymoon.
You should be more careful, Anna.	And you too, Ninotchka.
I have nothing to hide.	You should. I'll show you.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.	What are you serving?
Good evening, Anna.	Good evening, Ninotchka.
Good evening, Ninotchka.	Aren't you late?
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.	Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...	...des raisins de Madre, des framboises...
Or it might be the firing squad!	Or we can't go back to Russia!
And how is Lord Lavenham?	...and little Lady Beatrice?
You wouldn't like Razinin.	He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.	Just see how happy the people look... from here....
What a lovely room you have here.	How many families live here with you?
Let's be happy that we're all alive.	And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.	That's right... and we might as well face it.
Yes! We could stay with Leon!	Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!	And they might believe her in Moscow.
And they might believe her in Moscow.	What do you mean they might -- they will!
That must be the one!	Yes, he looks like a comrade!
We don't like Razinin.	We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
He's cutting our throat...	But what can we do?... We have to accept.
May I ask how much your rooms are?	Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.	Why should you be afraid?
It is high time you got out of Russia.	I must be stern with you.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.	Don't worry... there will be enough.
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?	With two f's, if you please.
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?	Oh, yes, yes.
Good morning, Your Highness.	Good morning, Gaston.
Good morning, Gaston.	Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.	That's all right.
What time have you, Gaston?	Eight forty-two, sir.
Eight forty-two, sir.	I guess it is eight forty-two.
I guess it is eight forty-two.	You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.	I am, Gaston.
Your breakfast, monsieur.	I don't feel like any breakfast.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...	Go to bed.
Good evening, Gaston.	Good evening, Monsieur.
Are they indeed? Thank you.	They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Is this satisfactory?	Thank you, Louis.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.	Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
Let's do that.	It's a real Paris reunion.
Leon, my little boy.	Oh, Leon, you are so good.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!	Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
We can call our ambassador.	I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.	Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
What did she say about me?	I think she covered you with the parasites.
And if we have to go to Siberia...	I'll send you a muff.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?	Get out of here!
We don't want to be disturbed.	My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.	If you want to see us you must come later.
If you want to see us you must come later.	I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.	But you can't...
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...	Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.	Too bad we have to waste all that time.
How much does this cost?	Two thousand francs.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.	I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
That's even better.	But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.	Even the swallows are back.
How are you, you three scoundrels?	Well, we're back home.
If there is anything we can do for you...	No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Allow me, Comrade.	No, thank you.
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.	Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.	That's two weeks from Thursday...
That's two weeks from Thursday...	We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
You want me to go in there?	I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
I must get into that country of yours!	Oh no. No visa.
What for... why?	Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!	Don't hold that against me... please!
Don't hold that against me... please!	Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Is this the wish of the masses?	It is their wish.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?	Who cried that one?
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.	Let's turn on the radio.
Let's turn on the radio.	Radio! What is radio?
Are we going to build our little house?	Yes... a little white house.
Yes... a little white house.	Not white, darling.
Not white, darling.	All right, we'll make it red.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!	And we won't stretch up our arms...
Our salute will be a kiss.	Yes... a kiss... salute!
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.	No. Nobody will find us.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!	And I adore you, Ninotchua.
But, darling, you can't do that.	Comrades! Good people of France!
Comrades! Good people of France!	Now, Ninotchka... please!
Darling, darling... please!	I must talk to my brothers!
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.	You must, darling.
You must, darling.	To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.	A funny story?
How do you do?	And General Savitzky.
I promise... I swear.	Did you make any change in this room?
Did you make any change in this room?	I don't think so.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?	Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
You see? Life can be so simple.	For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Do you like Scotch stories?	I have never heard one.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.	What are you after?
What are you after?	Must one always be after something?
Because we are an odd couple.	Then you should go back to your table.
I don't like your following me.	I didn't follow you.
I didn't follow you.	Then how did you get here?
Then how did you get here?	I always eat here.
I always eat here.	This is a place for workmen.
I must go.	Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...	Let's forget that we ever met.
As a representative of Moscow...	Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
You know I want to...	Then do it through my lawyer!
The telephone is ringing.	Oh, let it ring.
Was that talkative?	No, that was restful. Again.
Do you hear that?	It's twelve o'clock.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.	It's false sentimentality.
You are something we do not have in Russia.	Thank you. Thank you.
That is correct.	Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?	Your general appearance is not distasteful.
You repeat yourself.	I'd like to say it a thousand times.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.	Don't do it, please.
The bayonet? Did you really?	I was wounded before Warsaw.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.	A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.	Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
He takes good care of that.	He looks sad. Do you whip him?
He looks sad. Do you whip him?	No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?	Please don't misunderstand me...
Please don't misunderstand me...	Then you don't want me to go there.
Yes, it is.	I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
That's a strange angle.	Yes, very strange.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?	Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Can I help you?	You might hold this for me.
How long do we have to wait here?	Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.	At what intervals does he whistle?
No thanks, Swana.	Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.	I'm afraid that's what it is.
Has done what?	She's gone, Leon.
She's gone, Leon.	Do you expect me to believe that?
Am I interrupting?	Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?	How do you do?
You can't imagine.	That bad?  Old or young?
Did I hear something about jewels?	Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!	Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?	Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.	Did you win?
I must insist that you leave.	Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.	In that case I can only say good-by.
That's all right... I grow on people.	I must ask you to leave.
Well... that's my business, madame.	That's no business... that's a social injustice.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.	That depends on the tip.
What do you want?	May I have your bags, madame?
You want me to go to Constantinople?	Yes... leaving immediately.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.	I will do my best.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?	Yes, it does.
Yes, it does.	You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
May I ask why?	Please... sit down.
Raw carrots and beets.	Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
Where to, madame?	Can you recommend a restaurant?
Where do you eat?	At Pre Mathieu's.
At Pre Mathieu's.	Where is that?
Where is that?	It's just a place for workmen.
It's just a place for workmen.	Where is it?
Where is it?	Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
How do you do, my friend.	Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...	What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Why do you bring this up after so many years?	They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!	Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
You did say it, sir.	Never.  I never said that about Jews!
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...	Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.	"That's Helms.  He's ""sang froid,"" a world-class poker player."
"That's Helms.  He's ""sang froid,"" a world-class poker player."	Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
Where the hell is he?	Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...	So ... let's go ...
So ... let's go ...	He told me to take you to his conference room.
We could get that.	Uh huh ...
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.	Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.	Son of a bitch.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.	Yes ... I got the money.
It's a code or something.	I figured that out.
I figured that out.	I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?	You do it.
"The ""Old Man"" plays politics harder than anybody else."	You think this is just about politics?
What about England?	Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
We can't touch Hoover --	I thought the gloves were off.
Where's Hunt now?	In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
I know it well, sir.	It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Lincoln used it.	That was civil war.
That was civil war.	How do you see this?
Sir, the deadline is today.	Can we get around this, Al?
Can we get around this, Al?	It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.
May I say something, Mr. President?	There's no secrets here, Al.
I promised Iran to Townsend.	Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.	We could leverage Helms.
Because they're not Americans.	Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
I believe you're right, boss.	... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
"The blacks are lost, the ""schwartzes"" are gone ..."	Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
... he'd just found out about Track 2.	You never told him?
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.	How is this national security?
Well, why not?	Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...	That fruitcake!  What about him?
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.	Is it my turn?
Mom expects great things from you ...	Harold ... can I get you anything?
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.	What ... ?
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?	Cuba would be a small price to pay.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.	So President Kennedy thought.
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.	Not if I give you all the cards ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.	The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.	Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?	Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.	I never met the man.
Oh, my goodness ...	How about you?  Are you going to win?
How about you?  Are you going to win?	You should ask Bobby.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?	I won't tell him if you won't.
Why, you got a customer?	The White House.
The White House.	You're fucking me.
She's quite pretty.	Her name's Sandy ...
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...	But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.	Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.	Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?	How a fat man gets so many girls.
He was a politician.	Did you cry when he died?
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?	Yes, Mr. President.
Yes, Mr. President.	We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.	That was Mr. Kennedy.
That was Mr. Kennedy.	You don't think he was a hero?
You know, I voted for you in your last election.	I was the lesser of two evils.
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.	Looks can be deceiving ...
It broke my heart when Harold died.	That was a long time ago.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.	I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.	... Use his women.
But it was all we had.	... but it was all we had.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.	You're shittin' me.
You're shittin' me.	Where you from?
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?	Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...	What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?	I like jazz ...
I like jazz ...	Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...	Elvis I like, too.
Elvis I like, too.	Oh yeah, he's good.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.	Maybe I am.
What's in there?	POWs.  And their families.
POWs.  And their families.	So I'm supposed to be ...
So I'm supposed to be ...	Compassionate.  Grateful.
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?	Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
We got the press this time!	"And we got the ""big mo""!  We're back!"
Why didn't you?	You can't expect me to explain that to you.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.	What matters to me is whether you understand it.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?	You.  What' you're doing --
You.  What' you're doing --	And what am I doing?
And what am I doing?	I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.	Then what are you scared of, honey?
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?	I've missed you.
I've missed you.	Are you okay?
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.	Yes, it's been a long time ...
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.	Do you really want this, Dick?
Do you really want this, Dick?	This.  Above all.
This.  Above all.	And then you'll be happy?
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.	I don't want them to love me.
Were you planning to tell me?	We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
Dick, you should call Bobby.	He doesn't want me at the funeral.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.	You don't have to go.
I'll do it.  No more.	Are you serious?
Are you serious?	Yeah ... I'm out.
Yeah ... I'm out.	Is that the truth?
Is that the truth?	I'll never run again.  I promise.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?	I want a divorce.
I want a divorce.	My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Amen to that.	It's over, Dick.
It's over, Dick.	I'll concede in the morning.
I'll concede in the morning.	Not that.  Us.
Thank you, Fidel Castro.	You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
We lost ...	I know ...
I know ...	It's hard to lose ...
Whatcha mean by that?	You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.	Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
When did he die?	Nineteen zero and nine.
You don't know what he thinks.	Yes I do.
Yes, you've circled round.	How come're you doin that?
How come're you doin that?	I don't know. I feel overmatched.
That man that shot you died in prison.	In Angola. Yeah.
In Angola. Yeah.	What would you a done if he'd been released?
What would you a done if he'd been released?	I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.	I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Didn't know there was any.	She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
How'd you know I was here.	Who else'd be in your truck.
Who else'd be in your truck.	You heard it?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?	I deduced it. Once you walked in.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.	I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.	Well what would you call him.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.	Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
...I don't know what I do feel like.	"Try ""old"" on for size."
"Try ""old"" on for size."	Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.	No ID in her room?
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?	I don't know. My mind wanders.
You ain't heard from him?	No I ain't.
Not word one.	Would you tell me if you had?
It's not me he's in trouble with.	Who's he in trouble with then?
Who's he in trouble with then?	Some pretty bad people.
Some pretty bad people.	Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.	These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.	He won't neither. He never has.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?	Yessir. It was punched out.
How's that, Sheriff?	Natural to the line of work they was in.
Wasn't no bullet?	Yessir. Wasn't none.
Sir, I don't want to picture that.	Well I don't either!
What was the bullet?	Wasn't no bullet.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.	I'm ahead of you there.
Probably must be.	So when was he here?
So when was he here?	I don't know. Oh.
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.	Believe you're right.
Believe you're right.	That from the lock?
What about yours?	I'm hidin' behind you.
We goin' in?	Gun out and up.
But you don't believe it.	No. Probably I don't.
No. Probably I don't.	It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.	What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?	Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
That's the boy.	You figure him for a dope runner?
It could be.	I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.	The old boy shot by the highway?
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.	Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?	We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
...How'd you sleep?	I don't know. Had dreams.
I don't know. Had dreams.	Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?	Well they always is to the party concerned.
Well they always is to the party concerned.	Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
What do you think.	I can't plan your day.
I can't plan your day.	I mean, would you care to join me.
I mean, would you care to join me.	Lord no. I'm not retired.
I always am.	Don't get hurt.
Don't get hurt.	I never do.
I never do.	Don't hurt no one.
Don't hurt no one.	Well. If you say so.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.	That's very nice.
I got it Mama.	I didn't see my Prednizone.
I didn't see my Prednizone.	I put it in, Mama.
I put it in, Mama.	Well I didn't see it.
...You got no cause to hurt me.	No. But I gave my word.
No. But I gave my word.	You gave your word?
You gave your word?	To your husband.
Not like that. Not like you say.	I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
I wouldn't worry about it.	...I need to sit down.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?	She'll be all right.
She'll be all right.	She'll be all right?
What should I do?	You know what's goin' on?
What makes you say that?	I can hear it in your voice.
Yes I do.	I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.	You should be used to that.
You should be used to that.	I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.

I vote for the motel.	My kinda group!
You got a girl?	No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?	Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?	Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.	Hey, Sid, thanks.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.	But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.	Do you know that for sure?
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?	No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.	But it can't wait.
Thanks for covering for me.	No problem, but who's Susan?
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.	What? You've gotta be kidding!
You told us it would grow out an inch.	It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!	FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
The walls are steel, right?	Not that one.
Not that one.	NOT THAT ONE?!
That's your problem.	That's their problem.
Are you okay?	Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
One.  Squeeze.	This is ridiculous...
This is ridiculous...	Two.  Squeeze harder.
Two.  Squeeze harder.	I can't just...
Okay, okay!  Okay.	You got an idea?
What?  What do you want me to do?	What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.	I have the gun.
You should see the look on your face.	The fuck did you do that for?!
He said open it.	Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.	Not with me.  Not with people.
And we're never getting in.	Do me a favor and don't talk.
Do me a favor and don't talk.	Jesus, what was I thinking?
They won't get hurt.	What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Who is this guy?	Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.	This is insane.  I'm outta here.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?	You're an idiot.
Keep your voice down.	They're not supposed to be here!
They're not supposed to be here!	This was your department, Junior.
This was your department, Junior.	They're not supposed to be here!
They're not supposed to be here!	That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?	Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
Somebody called you?	Can we come in?
Can we come in?	What do you want?
What do you want?	We'd like to come in.
We'd like to come in.	No, you can't come in.
'Bout four o'clock.	I don't get it.
That door is a safely hazard.	Not at all.
Could the child please stop that?	KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
That's highly inappropriate.	I said open the door.
Cut it back a little bit.	No fucking way.
Watch your mouth.	It's okay, Raoul.
Ever read any Poe?	I don't think so, but I love her album.
I don't think so, but I love her album.	No, Edgar Allen.
No, Edgar Allen.	The furniture guy?
The furniture guy?	What's to keep them from prying open the door?
No cars.  Feet are faster.	How many more do we have after this?
What if I keep dropping?	Not an option.
Not an option.	What if I do?
Blue is phones?	Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
What are you doing?	I saw something, I saw...
Yeah, but where's the third guy?	Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.	Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
What, what, what is it?!	On the floor!  Get on the floor!
I am.  I'm here.	YOU HAVE TO!
YOU HAVE TO!	I'm here.  I'm here.
Why did the chicken cross the road?	What am I, a five year old?
What am I, a five year old?	Why did the chicken cross the road?
Why did the chicken cross the road?	I don't know, why?
I don't know, why?	To prove he wasn't chicken.
Are you freaking out?	Little bit.  Yeah.
"""Get the fuck out of my house."""	Get the fuck out of my house!
"""What we want is in that room."""	They're coming in here, aren't they?
Can't hear a thing.	What do they want?
What do they want?	I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
It doesn't work?!	Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
What's going on?!	People.  In the house.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.	The crowd goes wild.
Too many stairs.	Got us in here, didn't I?
Got us in here, didn't I?	Shoulda got an apartment.
Shoulda got an apartment.	Well, I know that now.
Alma I told you to...	Fuck that, we've got company...
Well... is it loaded?	"I tell you ""officer"", it wasn't..."
What are you doing with the gun?	What are doing with yours?.
You got to sit on Eldridge...	Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.	Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?	You know it brother.
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...	Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
What the fuck?	Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!	What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Hey... what the hell you doing?	Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Yeah, it's me.	Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Get out of the car.	What's with you?
What's with you?	Get out of the fucking car.
Yeah... whatever you say.	Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit...
Well don't go forgetting your friends.	Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.	You know it. Stay Black...
God damn... Kid never had a chance...	Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Motherfucker... you stay away...	Look this is bull...
Man, fuck you!!!	No Fuck you!!!
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?	Cy... I ain't even sure.
Cy... I ain't even sure.	C'mon we'll walk and talk...
C'mon we'll walk and talk...	Naw... I gotta...
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?	"No man. PE -- ""political education."""
I don't know. Look around man.	C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
I don't think that will be any problem...	You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
Did you shoot the officers in question?	Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Yes sir I was.	And did you witness the shoot-out?
And did you witness the shoot-out?	Yes sir, I did.
Yes sir, I did.	From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?	No sir he didn't.
We need money first...	Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.	Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.	Right on Brother Judge...
I don't know.	You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?	Yeah... let me think about it.
We appreciate your help with this.	So what's the deal?
We'll all get out of here together.	Later for that. I'm done either way...
"You got something on your mind... ""brother."""	"Yeah, ""brother"" My best friend is stone dead."
Just a kid.	Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Yeah, I do.	Well, act like it. Come on.
I saw... but...	But nothing... you do live here don't you?
God damn it's him. I gotta go.	Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
It was Sabu killed Cy.	Where is he?.
Where is he?.	Ain't no one seen him.
Ain't no one seen him.	Why didn't you tell me?
My Mom's at that.	Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
You believe that?	I don't know. I really don't.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.	You don't look alright.
You don't look alright.	Yeah... cop hit me...
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.	It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.	That would be nice.
You call that a compliment?	It's a start.
What do you mean, old and ugly?	You got me beat on both accounts.
You got me beat on both accounts.	The hell I do.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.	Pride will do.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?	I expect to try.
You got salt last week.	Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
You don't know him very well, do you?	He's my father.
I said, I'm not my sister.	I know that.
Of course, I do.	Very well, then.
How did this... how did I let this happen?	You couldn't have known.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.	Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
You look well, Charlotte.	As do you.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.	Who cared for your wounds?
That is a separate issue.	I consider them linked.
My pleasure, sir.	Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.	Colonel will do.
Colonel will do.	As you wish.
Are you going to meet with him?	Most certainly.  Arrange it.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?	You know what happened.
You know what happened.	No, I don't.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.	And what do they know?
Don't go in there.	Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?	She is.  Don't go in there.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?	Granted.  Where are you going?
You learned her lessons better than I.	She got me at a more impressionable age.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.	I should have killed him when I had the chance?
These four wagons must be his.	And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
How old are you?	You know how old I am.
You know how old I am.	God help us all when you're forty.
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.	Yes...  ... father.
Did your father teach you humility?	He tried.  It didn't take.
Is that so?	Yes, sir.  My father taught me.
We'd cover more ground if we split up.	It's safer if we stay together.
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.	You're in no condition to ride.
You're in no condition to ride.	I have no choice, I...
Have you seen any Redcoats?	Not yet.  What happened?
Is that why the Assembly was convened?	Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.	And the Governor?
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...	The middle colonies?
I don't care.  I hate him.	You don't hate him.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.	He left us.
Your son, what did you name him?	Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
Don't touch him.	How many men have we seen die?
How many men have we seen die?	Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.	I'm sorry, I didn't know.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?	Not held, just slowed down.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.	How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Who's in command?	I am, I think.
I am, I think.	What are my orders?
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.	I'll see to it that he serves under me.
And your principles?	I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
Name five hundred.	Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...	That's five, keep going...
That's five, keep going...	... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...	You said bribery twice...
You were an Englishman then...	I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.	It's Mister Marion.
It's Mister Marion.	I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.	Yes, quite, but you should know that...
But what about Thomas?	Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.
How far away?	Four, five miles.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?	Yes, he does.
How many came back?	About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
Put those away.	But father, they might come this way.
But father, they might come this way.	Put them away.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.	Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.	Is that right, dad?
Well...I guess not.	It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?	You'll see soon enough, hon.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?	Of course I will.
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--	Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?	He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.	Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
I'm not tired!	I'm sure you're not.
I'm sure you're not.	Then why do I have to go to bed?
You believe in it.	Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
But don't you dare say that.	I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
What's up, sugar?	Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
Ellie? What's wrong?	No more chocolate chip cookies.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.	I hate that smell.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?	Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?	For a little while.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?	Well, I thought it was safe--
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.	And because the dead walked.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.	Shit! Look at this mess!
Shit! Look at this mess!	Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.	I'm thinking about going to bed.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?	It's Ellie's cat.
It's Ellie's cat.	Nope. He's your cat now.
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.	This babe has said enough.
Rachel not feeling well?	Well...a touch of the flu...
Can I have another one?	I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Doesn't look like they last long.	Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about that.	Jud, why am I doing all this?
Jud, why am I doing all this?	Because it's right.
This was their burying ground, Louis.	Whose burying ground?
Why? For God's sake, why?	I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?	I guess so...but...
I guess so...but...	You want to rest a bit before you start?
Almost there, Louis.	You keep saying that.
You keep saying that.	This time I mean it.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.	You're telling me.
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.	Is there quicksand?
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?	You'll see before long. Let's go.
I'm not climbing that.	Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Going to tell Ellie?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
Bagged cat. What a mess.	You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.	Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Not yet...how much further is it?	Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
You need a glass?	Not at all.
Not at all.	Good for you.
You better get going, hon.	Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I'm going to try to do better.	You're doing fine.
Well, honey...you know that...	Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
That's enough of that kind of talk!	I just said--
I just said--	I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
She's finally asleep.	She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
I think it's rather extraordinary.	Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
Thank you. Thank you so much.	Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
And Buckaroo Banzai.	Come on--let's parole 'em.
Let her go. It's cool.	Louis, the house is beautiful.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!	Aye, aye, sir!
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?	Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.	That boat is my livelihood!
That boat is my livelihood!	You'll get it back.  Or one better.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.	Elizabeth goes free!
Elizabeth goes free!	We got that part.  Anything else?
What's in your head, boy?	She.  Goes.  Free.
She.  Goes.  Free.	You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.	You can't.  I can.
There's ... another exit?	Aye, for us there is.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?	Men!  Are you up for it?
No, I really think I do.	All right then.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?	You can go to your grave not knowing.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.	Wait as long as you like.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.	Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.	No you won't.
Do you not know what this is, then?	It's a pirate medallion.
It's a pirate medallion.	It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
Then why aren't you eating?	Would that I could.
Maid or not, it fits you.	Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?	Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
You've got sand, for a maid.	Thank you, sir.
Then I can wear men's clothing.	That would hardly be proper.
Commodore, you can't do that!	You're speaking up for him again?
I can't breathe.	I'm a bit nervous, myself --
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --	About the day we met. Do you remember?
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?	Yes -- yes.
If I had known --	-- then we never would have met.
I'm glad we got here in time.	Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.	Nor did you, I noticed.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?	The trees are taller.
You're in league with Barbossa!	No, I'm -- rescuing you.
How did you get off the island?	Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!	She can hold a bit longer.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?	That he is.
We're not going to just surrender!	That we are.
Blast it, I'm already awake!	I know.  That was for the smell.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?	I don't think that will be necessary.
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.	Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
This dock is off-limits to civilians.	Sorry, I didn't know.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.	I knew you'd listen to reason!
We had time to get to know each other.	We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?	Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Are you certain this is the right way?	It's the right way.
Just do it quickly.	Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
That's not true.	I swear, you look just like him.
I swear, you look just like him.	It's not true my father was a pirate.
It's not true my father was a pirate.	Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.	My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Is that so?	My father.  William Turner?
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!	Aye!  Avast!
This is either crazy, or brilliant.	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Not without my effects.	We need to go!
I can get you out of here.	How?  The key's run off.
Why ask me?	Because you're a pirate.
Because you're a pirate.	And you want to turn pirate yourself?
And you want to turn pirate yourself?	Never.  They took Miss Swann.
You threatened Miss Swann.	Only a little.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?	I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.	Mentioned it, is more what he did.
I think he's telling the truth.	He's not telling the truth.
He's not telling the truth.	He may be.
He may be.	If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?	And no lies!
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.	The Black Pearl is a real ship.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.	No, it's not.
No, it's not.	Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.	You've seen it?
You haven't seen it.	Yes, I have.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?	No.  She hasn't.
No.  She hasn't.	Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.	Bleak.  Very bleak.
He's still breathing.	Where did he come from?
How long do you leave him in there?	Until he's done.
What are you going to do to him?	Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?	No, thank you.
I know what you're doing.	You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You mean besides kicking your ass?!	You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
Did you feel that?	Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Poppy, please --	If you loved me like I loved you?
If you loved me like I loved you?	Poppy, this is not the time!
It will be an ascension.	I'm so excited, Icarus.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.	Then you still love me?
Then you still love me?	Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Why are there two ottomans?	Icarus, please!  This is important!
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?	No, Icky, this is real.
Do you think she will give us the designs?	Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.	And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?	That remains to be seen.
Icky!  What's happening?	Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
It's ready now, I know it is.	She says it's not.
She says it's not.	She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.	She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.	She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Like rotting meat.	You're not rotting meat.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?	Donated to science.  Perfect.
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.	Thank you, sir.
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.	Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.	Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
You don't want this.	Yeah, I do!
Is that what Argon told you?	No!  Well, not those exact words.
No!  Well, not those exact words.	Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
I don't believe this is happening...	Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
You were never invited to my house.	You're looking for a urine sample.
What did security say?	They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.	Well, you got another problem.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.	That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
Sir, please try to hold still.	So, I guess it worked.
What's it smell like?	Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.	Like Crazy Glue?
Things do change.	I guess they do.
I remember I was trying to help...	God, what a fight that was.
God, what a fight that was.	We were different people then.
You're not going after Argon!	I have to!
What would happen if I threw him into the core?	The same thing I suppose.
What in the...?	Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.	We've got to get the nanobot.
We've got to get the nanobot.	It's too late.  Argon injected it.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.	You mean he's polymerized, like me?
You saved my life.	Did you think I could just leave you...?
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!	I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Where is it?	Argon's private lab.
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.	You didn't think I could just leave you?
Who is he?	The head shrinker at the prison.
Did you go?	On the counter.
That's going to fit me?	Like a glove.
That's pretty good.	Getting used to it.
What did you want my hair for?	Something else I want to try.
How far can you stretch?	I don't know.
The nanobot... it's not here...	It's still inside me?
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.	Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
Probably the caffeine.	Do you have something to bring me down?
Just like old times.	Yeah.  Old times.
What's that supposed to mean?	Just giving credit where credit is due.
Just giving credit where credit is due.	You have no one to blame but yourself.
You have no one to blame but yourself.	Blame the victim.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!	I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!	And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Look at this!	What about it!
Is something wrong?	No, no, I just feel wired!
That was an egg?	Three days ago it was.
Three days ago it was.	What do these replicators do to people?
What are these?	Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
... just like the mouse.	Mouse?  What mouse?
Mouse?  What mouse?	My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.	What happened to it?
What happened to it?	I don't know.
Susie!  You gotta help me!	Daniel, what are you doing here?
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.	No, something is really wrong... look!
Daniel, give him the Trix.	Susan, this is the future of America here.
Yeah, we'll see.	We'll see?  What does that mean?
Nothing really worthwhile.	That's what I thought.

So they'll go.	I'm only paying two of you guys.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?	Just tell him to call me.
He did seem a little strange.	Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.	I'm sorry. You're right.
I'm sorry. You're right.	I think he's weird, but that's me.
I think he's weird, but that's me.	Should I call you later?
Should I call you later?	I'll just see you when you get back here.
I'll go pay for my car.	Are you sure?

It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.	They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.	I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?	Once or twice.
He's a writer, not a madman.	Then what's he doing here?
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --	No one's forcing you to listen.
At your service, Count.	Now give the signal.
Go back to your room. Quickly.	What? What've I done?
What? What've I done?	Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --	You'll hate me now, won't you?
By whom? The Marquis?	Mother's not half so blind as you.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.	"""Turn you out?"""
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.	I've you to look after me, haven't I?
In part, yes.	He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.	But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Has he hurt you?	His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
Free his mouth.	Mustn't do that, sir.
Mustn't do that, sir.	I must grant him his last rites.
I must grant him his last rites.	I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.	You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
Don't confuse one organ with another --	I know, because I felt it myself --
I know, because I felt it myself --	I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!	AND DID YOU?
AND DID YOU?	IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Go to hell!	Why was it you never took her by force?
Why was it you never took her by force?	Who's to say I did not?
Who's to say I did not?	Was it impotence?
It's no secret that you loved her.	Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --	I saw the longing in your eye --
I saw the longing in your eye --	-- that was lust --
-- that was lust --	-- the passion in your heart --
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?	Your words drove Bouchon to --
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.	Your wig. Remove your wig.
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!	Coulmier, you animal!
Coulmier, you animal!	I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.	What on earth would that require?
What on earth would that require?	A night spent with the partner of my choice.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.	You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?	I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?	Because your writing continues, unchecked.
-- water! --	-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
I have a proposition.	You always do.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.	"""Part the gates of heaven,"" as it were --"
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.	Good day, Marquis.
Good day, Marquis.	THEN BUGGER ME!
He can't do that to me.	How can one man possibly be so selfish?
You mean to take us all down with you?	Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
They can't be serious.	Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.	Mightier than the sword indeed.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?	I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.	Don't be so sure.
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?	It's not even noon --
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.	And my own.
And my own.	How is the patient faring?
Will you sleep soundly tonight?	No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.	HER NAME, ABBE.
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.	You'd suffer in her stead?
It was not inspired by circumstance.	No. It most certainly was not.
Do you favor its publication?	For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.	Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
I'll be waiting.	Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.	Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.	Come now, darling, give it a read.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!	Go on, child.
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --	A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
Surely you've seen a man naked.	It's only been described to me. In your books.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.	What's that then?
A kiss for each page.	Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.	There's something else I want from you.
I'm hungry for a proper visit.	Don't start --
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?	No. But tell him I would.
I am eternally in your debt.	And I in yours.
And I in yours.	Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Oh, but I am!	-- words alone are insufficient.
-- words alone are insufficient.	It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
It's tainted money, Doctor.	What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.	What thought is that?
You've come to lecture me?	To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?	They've put you up to this, haven't they?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?	You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?	....shame on you, truly...
I'd rather read, thank-you.	You prefer a book to your husband's company?
Leave at once --	But it's just begun --
But it's just begun --	Do as I say.

I expected more from you.	Sorry to disappoint.
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!	Orson, please ... it's too bright

Who the hell's Manolete?	The great Spanish bullfighter
The great Spanish bullfighter	I don't wanna write about no spic.

We find the man and then we dissect him-	Like a bug.
Like a bug.	But with compassion and insight--
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.	You're a laugh-riot, kid.
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.	Yeah, ain't it swell?
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--	Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
To do what?	That's for me to decide.

This is the baby sitter.	Oh. When are they expected home?
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?	He has it. Thank you.
Name me a better photographer.	But his leg!
But his leg!	Don't worry -- it comes off today.
This is Doyle, Jeff.	Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Where'd they take Lisa?	Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.	Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
But I'm not a killer!	Your logic is backward.
Did you ever own a saw?	Well, in the garage, back home, we --
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?	You figured that out, huh?
Who said they left then?	Who left -- where?

She -- was -- an -- invalid!	You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.	All right -- you don't believe me.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.	That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.	Next time, have some good news.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?	With that cast on -- you don't.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!	So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
For getting rid of that cast.	Who said I was getting rid of it?
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?	Who are you?
One hundred and twenty-seven.	How much do you think you'll need?
What do you need money for?	To bail Lisa out of jail.
Smart? She'll be arrested!	That'll get her out of there, won't it?
What are you two talking about?	Got a shovel?
There's probably one in the basement.	Now wait a minute --
Thank heaven that's over!	I have a feeling we've just begun.
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?	And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
A Federal offense.	Get back there! He'll see you!
What about this morning? Any developments?	No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.	In this heat?  They're up now.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.	Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Keep your mind off her.	She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.	And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.	And some man will lose his.

Isn't he a salesman?	Now what could he sell at three in the morning?

Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.	He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?	Depends one which one.
She's just not the girl for me.	She's only perfect.
I knew it!	Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.	You've got a hormone deficiency.
You've got a hormone deficiency.	How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.	Well, I only quote from the best.
It is something really important, Jeff?	I'm afraid it is, Tess.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.	I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.	Goodnight, you idiot.
Goodnight, you idiot.	Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?	Not yet, Jeff.
Not yet, Jeff.	You haven't even heard from him?
You haven't even heard from him?	Not a word.
Shut up. I'm all right.	Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Is he cleaning house?	He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.	No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
I hate funny exit lines.	Who was the trunk addressed to?
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.	Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
From his landlord -- once a month.	It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.	You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
That's a suitcase?	A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.	Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
We have all -- what?	Night. I'm going to stay with you.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.	You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
Something on your mind, Lisa?	It doesn't make sense to me.
Women aren't that unpredictable.	Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
I wonder where he's going now?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Suppose he doesn't come back again?
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --	What about it?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.	To get on home.
To get on home.	All right -- but what's he doing now?
What's the apartment house number?	125 West Ninth Street.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?	What are you getting at?
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.	Now, Lisa --
You'd better before you catch the disease!	What is it you're looking for?
Maybe she died.	Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
What do you think?	Something too frightful to utter.
Don't you ever have any problems?	I have one now.
I have one now.	So do I.
So do I.	Tell me about it.
Nothing, thank heaven.	Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?	I wouldn't dare answer that.
I wouldn't dare answer that.	Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?	Without any future?
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.	"You mean ""goodnight."""
"You mean ""goodnight."""	I mean what I said.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?	Right now, it doesn't seem so.
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?	Of course not.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.	No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
How can you tell that -- from here?	You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
I wish there was one I wanted.	Make the one you want.
Make the one you want.	You mean leave the magazine?
You can't buy that kind of publicity.	That's good news.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!	I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Something big going on somewhere?	Going on right here. It's a big night.
Going on right here. It's a big night.	It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.

That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.	We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.	Who buys them? Tax collectors?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?	Only because it's expected of her.
How's your leg?	Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.	And your stomach?
And your stomach?	Empty as a football.
Empty as a football.	And you love life?
And you love life?	Not too active.
Not too active.	Anything else bothering you?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.	What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
A new disease.	Friend of yours?
Friend of yours?	I'm glad they let you out.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.	They always live.
I like you, you know?	Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?	We got to do something.  Don't we?
Where can we meet?	Know the Millertown bluff?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.	I'm cute, too.
How'd he get in?	Smashed the front door.
Smashed the front door.	Any other entrance?
Any other entrance?	Down in back.
What time is it?	Hang loose.  We got all night.
Hang loose.  We got all night.	That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.	You still want to go home, Moose?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!	I think I should go home.
I think I should go home.	No.  We're going to bring him down.
No.  We're going to bring him down.	Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?	You clean out of your head?  Come on!
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.	I don't want to learn that!
Will you wait a minute?	You don't want me to go.
Will you let him tell it!	She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
Is there some kind of trick answer?	What would you do, Dad?
And you dropped it?	Yeah!  Shh!

All my clothes --	That's right -- worry about your clothes --
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.	Maybe it's better that way.
Maybe it's better that way.	You don't mean that Clay.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?	Why do you think?
Are we leaving?	It's too light yet.
I'll make the soap myself.	But the rest is right.
But the rest is right.	Will she be dark or fair?

I -- lost something.	It wouldn't happen to be this...
Is that the only reason you came back?	Sure. What other reason would there be?
Sure. What other reason would there be?	I just wondered. Let's go.
You know what she asked me?	I don't care what she asked you.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.	You better start.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?	Just the grub box and bed rolls.
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.	That's right, Steve.
That's right, Steve.	Can I have my gun back?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.	Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.	And meet him there.
And meet him there.	Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
At the ranch maybe?	Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
What was he in jail for?	You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.	In a fight?
In a fight?	The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
How does she draw?	A little hot.

All right, you didn't know.	I can't take her with me.
I can't take her with me.	Nobody asked you to.
You're not bein' quite fair.	What's there to be fair about?
All right, you didn't know.	I can't take her with me.

She mustn't -- don't you let her --	There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --	If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
Stop it -- stop it.	Darling -- now I've got you all upset.

Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.	You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
What is it?	Just a thing I was workin' on.
Just a thing I was workin' on.	The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
You got no business snoopin' around --	Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.	They went on like I told you.
What's the matter -- restless?	Yes, people make me restless.
There aren't any women here.	I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.	Well, say it.
Goodbye and thanks.	I don't like to see you go.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.	They shouldn't have done that.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.	Maybe you are. I'm not.
Go on. Have another try at him.	What's the use.
Maybe I better start working on him.	You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
You're not giving up?	How many ways can a man say no.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?	Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.	We don't want to go there.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.	He certainly could. About a month.
He certainly could. About a month.	What are you waiting for? Do something.
I tried my best, but these things take time.	And we're running out of that.
And we're running out of that.	There's still tomorrow morning.
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...	Now where's she goin'? --
How far up the trail?	I don't know -- I don't know.
Where is he?	Up the trail.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?	Stop it --
How do you know who we are?	Everybody knows --
Everybody knows --	Who brought you here?
We got company. Female company.	Yeah, we sure have.
Because there's a man I want to see.	He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.	Put on another one.
Why, yes. They're all I need...	Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.	If you need me, I'll be --
You were supposed to be reading words.	I was doin' both. Here.
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?	Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --	What do they look like?
How about California?	Would they be good to eat?
And that's tough, isn't it?	Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
What comes after Z?	That's the end of the line.
That's the end of the line.	Then I know my alphabet.
Aren't we stayin'?	No. We're not stayin' --
Gee, I can't.	Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.	Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
Good night, Miss Wells.	Good night, Steve.
You're so nice.	Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Would you like to learn them?	I sure would.
I sure would.	Maybe I could start you out.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?	Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?	I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
No, I won't let you do it.	Alex, what are you doing?
I think he wants me.	Ha! Right bitch!
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.	I found a picture of his wife.
Me, too. 101?	"In room ""302"" at ten o'clock?"
My favorite memory was when we --	Would you die already?!
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.	Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.	Okay... maybe that would be best.
Cindy, what's going on?	It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.	Hey, I have an idea...
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.	No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.	Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.	Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Really? That's amazing.	Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.	No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
He's right. I should go first.	He's so brave.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.	Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Shhh... It's okay.	Ray, have you been here all this time?
Ray, have you been here all this time?	I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.	I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.	So, I guess I can go now.
What should we get?	I don't care. You pick.
Hey, wanna' share a soda?	Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.	Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.	Then what are we going to do?
I know, but I've been thinking --	I know, but I've been thinking --
I know, but I've been thinking --	Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --	Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --	Look, what I'm trying to say --
Look, what I'm trying to say --	Look, what I'm trying to say --
Cindy, let me...	No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Can you feel that?	No. Try a little higher.
What about you, Buddy?	Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.	Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Where the hell are we?	It looks like the furnace.
It looks like the furnace.	Let's get outta here.
Let's get outta here.	Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.	Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.	Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.	Okay. See you later, friend.
So, I see you're really into spooks.	No. I never date outside my race.
No. I never date outside my race.	I meant you're into ghosts.
I meant you're into ghosts.	Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Hey, you left your book back there.	Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Let her go, Cin.	But he'll kill her!
But he'll kill her!	That means more screen time for us.
Okay, I get the point.	So, whatever happened to her?
So, whatever happened to her?	She killed herself a week before he died.
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.	Thanks, I'll be fine.
Are you okay?	I think so.
I think so.	Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?	Yeah, I broke my fall.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?	This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?	Right behind you.
How about these buns?	Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?	It's the sequel.
This can't be happening?	Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Stop touching his brain!	Um, I'm not touching anything.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!	No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.	Thanks. I made them by hand.
What are we gonna do?	We have to destroy him.
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.	Quick, everyone to the lab.
What the hell are you doing?	Just wait, you'll see.
Would you like me to help you pass them back?	I don't need your help.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?	Soon, but first I must bless this house.
My child, you're alive!	Yes, we made it!
Yes, we made it!	We? What do you mean... we?
My child you are the only survivor.	No, my friends are right here!
Hey, y'all! What's going on?	Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
That was a great idea, Shorty.	I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Aww, the little bird died.	Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.	Hey, I got an idea.
Am I cool now?	Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Yo! That jacket is tight.	Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!	Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!	Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...	Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
So, do you think you made it into the class?	I don't know, but I sure hope so.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.	You could use the grade, huh?
I don't like this, this...	Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
I take it you're not mad at me.	I wouldn't go that far.
Got a problem with that?	Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.	Theo, did you see the animal?
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?	It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.	Got my camera right here.
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?	Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Professor, we need to talk.	What is it, Dwight?
What is it, Dwight?	I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
The image there.	Are you sure it's not the tape?
Professor, I think you should see this.	What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?	Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.	Even in the bathroom?
Would you please focus?	Fine.  What's all this stuff?
In about fifteen minutes.	Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
Here you go, Professor.	Are these all the subjects?
Let me help you.	I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
I finished all the interviews.	Let me see the files.
Let me see the files.	They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
She's right. We should stick together.	Alright. Come on, you guys.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?	Oh, I couldn't do that.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?	Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
What are you working on?	Just a little experiment.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?	Yours, or the turkeys?
Yours, or the turkeys?	I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
You mean to tell me we're dead!	I guess so.
You're not wearing a belt.	Alright, go to the belt store...
A little bit... Give me your belt.	I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.	Okay, give me my belt.
It's okay. I understand.	How is she?
Uh... I'm Father McFeely	Father, come in, please.
Father, I think you should rest.	No, I'm fine.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.	Because she will lie?
Because she will lie?	No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
Would you like to see the girl?	Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.	Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Shorty, why don't you say grace?	Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
Yo son, check this out.	Dog, you look hot.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.	Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
I woke up naked, too.	Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.	What does it say?
What does it say?	"It says, ""Ray."""
"It says, ""Ray."""	Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.	Get out?! What does it say?
Bring her home... I guess.	No more violence... No more violence...

I don't like this.	Which room is it?
Which room is it?	It's the last door at the end of this hall.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?	"That's what I tried to find out.
You think my sister is there?	You can't tell.
You can't tell.	Can we go there now?
Yes, I understand.	Then, you also understand that you must die.
But tell me --	She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?	Oh, as beautiful as ever.
I haven't got that much in cash.	How much have you got?
How much have you got?	About forty-five dollars.
About forty-five dollars.	For the time being, I imagine that must do.
How much does she want?	She could use a hundred dollars.
She could use a hundred dollars.	I'll give you a check.

Do you know what this is, Frances?	I ought to know.

What did she want?	I did her hair.

I know  I shouldn't have told you	No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
What have you done about Irving August?	Oh, I'm making investigations.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.	The people at the restaurant?
But you do believe me?	The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?	But I'd give a great deal to know.
She'll have to know some time.	Not from me.
Let her know what?	That you love Mary.
Could you find him?	I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Do you think he knows about this?	I don't know.

I don't know.	You will die.
Who are you?	I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.	What's wrong, Mary?
And Gregory -- he loves her.	He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.

Yes. When I tell you.	Tell me what?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?	What a peculiar question.

This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.	I'll be out in a minute.
I'll be out in a minute.	That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
I'm afraid not.	That's too bad.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.	Thank you, my dear.
She's not been here for a long time.	But she was here?
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.	Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -

You're really never going to make love again?	I'm not planning on it.
Who was the last person you had sex with?	Her name was Elizabeth.

Do you think that's such a good idea?	Don't you want to make one?
Don't you want to make one?	Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.	What difference does it make why I do it?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?	That's a good question.
That's a good question.	What do you have to do to get ready?

How did you know?	She said it on her tape.
She said it on her tape.	Why didn't you tell me?
What... what are these interviews about?	The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
What about sex?	Everything about sex.
And they just answer them?	Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.	I don't... why... why do you do this?

You son of a bitch!!	Not very often.
Where did you go when you left here?	I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.

I'm not either!!	Why don't I believe you?
Who'd you have lunch with?	I ate by myself.
Yes. I just got busy.	That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.

What do you mean, like physically?	Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
What do you mean?	Did you masturbate?
So it was recently that you tried this.	Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.

Ann, do you see a pattern here?	What do you mean?
Here it is.	What is it?
What is it?	It's a sun dress.

You know what I mean, you don't even know him!	I feel like I do.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.	You are in serious trouble.
I don't want to discuss it.	Then why do you keep asking about it?
Why did you do that?	Because I wanted to.
Because I wanted to.	But why did you want to?
But why did you want to?	I wanted him to see me.
He wouldn't do that.	You don't know that for sure.
You don't know that for sure.	Well, it's too late now, isn't it?

Did he touch you?	No, but I did.
No, but I did.	You touched him?
He just asked me questions.	What kinds of questions?
What kinds of questions?	Questions about sex.
Questions about sex.	Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
No, it's nothing like that.	Well, what? Is he dangerous?

A card? For her fiftieth birthday?	What's wrong with that?
Will you stop? Jesus.	I just thought it might --
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.	I say it because it's descriptive.
Ann, you always underestimate me.	Well, I wonder why.
He doesn't have a phone.	Well, I'll call him when he does.
Well, I'll call him when he does.	But he won't.
But he won't.	What are you talking about?
I wish you'd get an answering machine.	There's a phone here.
There's a phone here.	It was busy.
No? Not even one more?	I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.	I can't talk you into it?
I can't talk you into it?	No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?	Cynthia, I don't know.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.	Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.	Is that what he tells you?
Is that what he tells you?	He doesn't have to tell me.
Would you like me to take my pants off?	If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.	Do you like the way I look?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.	Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.	Describe for me your first sexual experience.
When I was fourteen.	Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?	Very much live.
Very much live.	What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
What did he say?	He said that my hand felt good.
He said that my hand felt good.	Then what happened?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.	What do you get?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?	Why don't you let me tape you?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.	What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
You just want to ask me questions?	I just want to ask you questions.
I just want to ask you questions.	And that's all?
Would anybody else see the tape?	Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.	How do we start?
How do we start?	I turn on the camera. You start talking.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.	And you ask questions, right?
Do I sit or stand?	Whichever you prefer.
Whichever you prefer.	I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?	Just a moment.
Who are you?	I'm Cynthia Bishop.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.	Do I know you?
Do I know you?	I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
You want me to leave?	I just want to know why you're here.
How did you find me?	I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
God, you... you're mean.	I know. Will you please leave now?
John, we have nothing to talk about.	I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.	No, John, things are getting real simple.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.	She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.	I just... Ann is very...
It won't. I trust him.	You trust him.
Look, are we going to do it or not?	Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.	Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...	How about straightening up the living room?
What's so stupid about it?	That you... you don't even know the guy.
I like the way he dresses.	What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Do you want me to stop calling?	Look, I'll call you, okay?
Nothing wrong with trying.	I don't think my sister would agree.
Not today. I've got other plans.	Oh.  Well, when, then?
Oh.  Well, when, then?	How about inviting me over to dinner?
How about inviting me over to dinner?	You know what I mean.
You know what I mean.	Yeah, I know what you mean.
Could be risky.	Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.	No, I mean doing it at my house.
No, I mean doing it at my house.	Afraid of getting caught?
I've got to get back to the office.	I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Plenty of room for two people.	It'll just be me.
No.  You said three-fifty?	Plus first and last month deposit.
Plus first and last month deposit.	Will you lease month-to-month?
Will you lease month-to-month?	Not for three-fifty.
Not for three-fifty.	How about for five hundred?
Answer him, goddammit!!	You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
I like having the car, the car is important.	Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.	Or go someplace in a hurry.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.	What do you mean?
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?	You were prying before?
Really. How'd it go?	She held up very well.
Brian Kirkland, please.	May I ask who's calling?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.	Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.	He said immediately.
He said immediately.	All right, jesus.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?	He sounded fine.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.	Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
But where are you going?	Down to the incinerator.
No. I don't think so.	Well? Supper at my place?
Well? Supper at my place?	OK. But late.
OK. But late.	Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?	No. Dotty's the last.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.	Do I get a kiss?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.	Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.	Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
You say something?	Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Gonna cut me open?	Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Didn't seem worried about them.	Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?	That's the one.
Want me to breathe deeply?	Just breathe normally.
I don't get it.	Lemme clarify for you.
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?	Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?	Did I say anything?
Well, at least you still talk the same.	So who changes?

Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?	"Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from ""One Life to Live""?"
The fuck was that?	The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.	I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
Why are you being so defensive?	I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --	Well, then put him at the singles table.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.	Good. That's good.
It's Christine.  Hey you.	You guys having fun?
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.	It'll just take a second.
Are you there? Miles?	Yeah, I'm here.
So I guess that's it.	You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.	How's the trip?
You got it.	Say, is Maya working?
What do you think?	Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.	I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.	They're just leftovers.
They're just leftovers.	Is it chicken?
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.	Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
What happened to you guys?	Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?	Good. How're you?
Good. How're you?	Great. You look great.  You both do.
Great. You look great.  You both do.	Not so bad yourself.
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.	I know. I might need to be spanked.
No, we're paying for the wine.	I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.	Well, in that case...
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.	I am one of those guys.
I am one of those guys.	You are not.
Are you a writer too?	No, I'm an actor.
No, I'm an actor.	Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Anything I'd know?	Maybe. Recognize this?
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.	Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?	You were wearing your belt.
Love you, man.	Back at you.
Well. That about does it.	Why don't you come in?
Why don't you come in?	Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.	So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.	You need a new car anyway.
What the fuck!	You said it looked like a car accident.
You said it looked like a car accident.	What the fuck!
What the fuck!	I'll pay for it.
Come on, let me drive.	I'm fine. You rest.
I'm fine. You rest.	I feel like driving.
Want me to drive?	No, I'm okay.
No, I'm okay.	Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Yep. Quite a day.	Quite a week.
So what's the plan?	The plan is... you go.
No way. No way.	Please, Miles, please.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.	That's five clicks, Jackson.
What's it look like to you?	Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
Huh. Let me think.	You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.	Keep it elevated.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.	Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.	You ever actually been in there, Miles?
You ever actually been in there, Miles?	I don't have to.
I don't have to.	I say we check it out. You never know.
Do you like them?	Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.	Are they too sporty?
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...	Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
What exactly are we going to do?	I said okay?
I said okay?	You have to tell me --
You have to tell me --	I SAID OKAY?
Is it the money thing?	Is what the money thing?
Fucker hit into us.	Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!	Throw me his ball.
What is it?	I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
What do you think's going on?	Could be anything.
Could be anything.	Been checking your messages?
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.	Can you give me some room here?
Can you give me some room here?	Oh yeah. Sure.
Understanding of what?	Like I might be in love with another woman.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.	What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.	What? Of course I like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.	You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.	That was three years ago after that first party!
Well, I've been doing some thinking.	Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Where is Stephanie?	Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.	What the fuck are you doing?
What'd Christine say?	Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
You should call her.	I will.  See ya!
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.	Oh Jesus, Miles.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.	Well, she is cute.
Get the trunk.	You have the keys.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.	Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!	I want to go home now.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?	What do you think?
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.	Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.	She what?  When?
She what?  When?	About a month ago. Six weeks.
About a month ago. Six weeks.	To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
Have you no shame?	Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
How do you know?	No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.	Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.	And she likes Pinot.
She works for tips!	You're blind, dude. Blind.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.	You know her?
You know her?	Sure I know Maya.
Sure I know Maya.	You know that chick?
She is very hot.	And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
Here's to my last week of freedom.	It's going to be great. Here's to us.
It's not even a mile.	We should have driven.
If that's what feels right.	It does. Feels right.
It does. Feels right.	Then it's a good thing.
Then it's a good thing.	Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Hey Jack, hurry up!	Just a minute!
You know, you could work in a wine store.	Yeah, that would be a good move.
That's what you do with every one.	When do we get to drink it?
What do you smell?	I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.	Now we're talking.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?	I told you. Filet and salmon.
Let me call Christine.	Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.	I owe her a call anyway.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.	Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
How old's she going to be?	Um... seventy... something.
Um... seventy... something.	That's a good age.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?	Oh yeah. Much better.
Don't open that now. It's warm.	Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?	You said you had it all lined up.
I can't help the traffic.	Come on. You're fucking hungover.
But you wanted to fuck me first.	Oh, Maya. No.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?	He's an actor, so it can't be good.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.	Great. What's the latest we can get there?
I had class.	Well, nice to see you now.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.	Good. So did I.
Good. So did I.	Okay. See you around.
Okay. See you around.	Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Um... did you still want to read my novel?	Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
What about me?	I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Yeah? Like what?	Like what a fraud he was.
What's the title?	"""The Day After Yesterday."""
"""The Day After Yesterday."""	Oh. You mean... today?
Oh. You mean... today?	Um... yeah but it's more...
Um... yeah but it's more...	So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.	I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.	Yeah, weird. But great.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.	Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.	Is she sleeping or...?
How long have you been into wine?	I started to get serious about seven years ago.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.	What was the bottle that did it?
Are you all right?	Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
I'm having the salmon.	That's what I'm having.
Nice. Very nice.	Twelve months in oak.
Twelve months in oak.	On a Sauvignon Blanc?
This is good. Little hints of clove.	I know. I love that.
What are you drinking?	A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.	Oh yeah? How is it?
I finished it.	Good for you.
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.	Maya, how are you?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.	Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?	You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Not me. I'm not drinking.	You quit drinking?
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.	See you over there, Miles.
That was big of him.	Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
So what's happening with your book?	Universally rejected. Strike three.
Universally rejected. Strike three.	Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.	Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.	I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Victoria! How the hell are you?	Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Sir, what are you doing?	I told you I need a drink.
I told you I need a drink.	Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.	This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
How much skin and stem contact?	About four weeks.
About a year.	French or American?
See you, Miles. You take care.	Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
So what do you think?	Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?	I just got divorced. Phyllis.
You talked to Wendy?	Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
It makes me feel better.	Does she ever answer back?
What are you thinking about?	Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?	It tastes old.
I don't want you to die.	Who said I was going to die?
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?	I heard them Morgan.
It tastes funny.	He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
I think it's contaminated.	You don't even know what that word means.
And tell Merrill to swing away.	What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
Does it hurt?	I don't feel much.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.	You love walks.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.	You got two minor league home run records don't you?
We won't be able to get out of there.	I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
He was only a year and half old.	What are you doing?
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?	Should we make a run for it out the back?
Should we make a run for it out the back?	They're right behind the door.
This is going to do nothing.	We have to go in the basement.
Should we turn off the lights?	They already know we're here.
Where are you going?	Ray Reddy's house.
What time is it?	Eleven a.m. They're gone.
How can you say that?	That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Morgan, be careful.	I got him.
It was very dark.	Yes, it was.
It was very dark.	Yes it was.
Explain, act crazy?	Curse and stuff.
Curse and stuff.	I'm not going to curse.
I'm not going to curse.	You don't mean it. It's just for show.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.	It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.	Just make noises then.
Are you going to do this or what?	No I'm not.
No I'm not.	You want him coming in the house next time?
Did someone save me?	Yeah baby. I think someone did.
They'll read our minds!	You're scaring your sister.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.	Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
What about Isabelle?	We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.	Where are we going to sleep?
Where are we going to sleep?	The family room.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.	That means they're unemployed.
I'm getting out now.	Don't do it.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.	It's old Morgan.
These are D's; I need double A's.	I have some upstairs.
It needs batteries.	Edgar, come inside.
Is he okay?	Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.	He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.	You take care of yourself...  Graham.
He definitely wasn't a midget.	Okay.  So he was tall?
Okay.  So he was tall?	I would say so.
Second thing this week I can't explain.	What was the first thing?
What about them?	There are none.
It's the strangest thing Father.	Don't call me Father.
It's like War of the Worlds.	They think it might happen all at once.
Don't do it!	You'll lose the signal!
I think we lost 'em.	There's nobody coming?
What friend is that?	The one with the shotgun.
All I did was kiss a girl.	That's why they got you in jail?
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!	Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
I didn't know you were out.	Did it seem short to you?
McKendrick's men got him.	Is he alive?
Where are we?	Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Maybe we'll see you sometime.	Yeah... maybe. So long.
Where were you?	Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?	I already did that.
Are you all right?	This is a brutal land.
This is a brutal land.	You must have known that before you came.
You must have known that before you came.	It's one thing to know it...
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.	Yeah... that must have been it.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.	Didn't Paden tell you that?
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.	I just came out to say goodbye.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.	They've been kind to me.
They've been kind to me.	Paden sends his best.
Paden sends his best.	I guess I put a good scare into him.
More than enough.	Have you thought at all about your plans?
Hobart, what are you people doing here?	This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.	Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.	And they were two of them. Look --
You're not Baxter?	My name is Emmett.
My name is Emmett.	And you're not Baxter, either?
I haven't done anything.	I want you out of town before the hanging.
I want you out of town before the hanging.	I'll be long gone.
You might make a farmer yet.	I've got a job.
I'll see you around.	Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.	Anybody got any ideas?
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.	No hard feelings.
No hard feelings.	C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.	You haven't got any money.
You haven't got any money.	All right, you buy me a drink.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.	He is that.
He is that.	I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
Doesn't look quite fair.	Which way do you mean?
What's Turley like?	It's a town...
It's a town...	They got a saloon there?
I gotta be going.	Going to Turley, was it?
Going to Turley, was it?	Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
Where's the pinto going?	I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Offend anybody lately?	Not for five years.
Get out of here, Jake.	All I did was kiss the girl.
This a friend of yours?	He is now.
He is now.	Who is he?
Who is he?	Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
Where's your brother?	He'll be here.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?	We didn't get that far.
We didn't get that far.	Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?	I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.	Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.	The other guy drew first.
What are you talking about?	I'm done talking. Get out.
I'm done talking. Get out.	You can't do this.
That ain't right.	I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?	Don't press your luck, Carter.
What's all this then?	This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.	I don't like that word much, Carter.
The jury saw it differently.	So this is the guy you're going to hang?
So this is the guy you're going to hang?	Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.	I was afraid of that.
Now let's talk about you chaps.	We'd rather stay.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.	Rae, I need help.
Rae, I need help.	Why come to me?
What's stopping you?	They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.	What makes you think I could?
What makes you think I could?	Why would they stop you?
Why would they stop you?	Because I'm your sister.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.	It's none of your business.
It's none of your business.	Rae, all we got is each other.
Rae, all we got is each other.	I don't have any family any more.
He was murdered.	Who did it?
Yeah, it's working out real good.	Where's Emmett now?
Why are they doing this, Mal?	Because they enjoy it.
I heard that too.	Did you hear his son is still around?
What about his brother?	We'll handle that. He's careless.
I'm going to have to look into this.	Yeah, maybe I will too.
Yeah, maybe I will too.	I thought we talked about that.
What is it you want from me?	Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.	I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.	So we understand each other?
Easy, boy. Just an idea.	Well, thanks, but forget it.
I took out thirteen dollars.	This is a lot of money.
This is a lot of money.	I told you this was a sweet set-up.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.	It is that.
It is that.	Maybe you could run it without Stella.
Nothing like that will happen between us.	Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
What brings you into my saloon?	Luck, I guess.
You got a place to stay?	I just got to town.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.	Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.	I've given that up.
You've got a legitimate job.	Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
I see you're prospering without me.	It's been a while.
It's been a while.	Where's the dog?
How about you?	I don't want you to get hurt.
I don't want you to get hurt.	He can't hurt me if he's dead.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.	I'm ready for that.
What is it that I can't figure?	What do you mean?
Where's the dog now?	He left me.
You really are a gambler.	Give me some of the good stuff.
That's the good stuff.	Oh, yeah? How good?
Who's the owner?	Here he comes right now.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.	And I know what I'm talking about.
And I know what I'm talking about.	You like a good saloon?
You like a good saloon?	It's the only place I'm happy.
It's the only place I'm happy.	Me too. What's wrong with us?
You work here?	I run the place. What can I get you?
I wouldn't worry about that.	I thought you two would get along.
Okay -- for you.	Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --	I'm glad we talked.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.	Not if I don't let her.
I just read somewhere --	I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
As a matter-of-fact I am.	When is she coming over?
When is she coming over?	About now.  Would you like a drink?
About now.  Would you like a drink?	I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.	I can imagine.
My two favorite girls.	Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.	Excuse me?  Start?
Viktor, you should have said something.	She doesn't want pity.
She doesn't want pity.	You're so good to protect her like this.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.	-- I can explain.
-- You can't go in there!	-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
Soon.  Soon.	Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.	Everyone you know is lying.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?	Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
She'll drive herself.	Hair and make-up?
Hair and make-up?	She'll do her own.  Theater training.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.	She was in the theater?  When? Where?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?	I'll send you her resume.
"Well, we have to do something about this -- ""stuntwoman""."	What about it?
What about it?	There isn't one.
There isn't one.	No need.  She does all her own stunts.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.	Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane?	Even the fall from the plane.
Even the fall from the plane.	Well, shoot it on the last day.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.	No problem.  Do you want to come in?
I can't wait to meet her.	I don't know if that's going to happen.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.	Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Out of the question.  A circus like that?	Viktor, it's my studio.
Where is she?	Good to see you too, Elaine.
Good to see you too, Elaine.	Why isn't she with you?
-- It's called a projector.	-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?	Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
Where are you?	Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
So you did meet her?	Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?	I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.	Just a minute.
Thank Simone for the tickets.	It was a great show, Dad...
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?	I have to talk to her.
What?... What did you say?	Do what you do to Simone.
Do what you do to Simone.	What I do to Simone?
What I do to Simone?	Yes, call me Simone.
You're with me to be close to her?	Is that a problem?
You look so, so...	... so much like her?
... so much like her?	Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.	I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?	How about the nudity?
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.	I know what you mean.
Is she here?	I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?	Somebody said she was here.
There's... a wall between you --	-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
"""Straw God"" changed my life."	You saw that?
You have to see her.	I've seen them all before.
I've seen them all before.	Not like this --
Not like this --	Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?	"-- We call them ""vactors""."
"-- We call them ""vactors""."	I need flesh and --
I need flesh and --	-- Flesh is weak.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.	"There's a rumor that you're more than just ""good friends""?"
About you and mom?	Me and Simone.  What I did.
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?	It's fantastic -- it's too much.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.	"It's the car she drove in ""Eternity Forever""."
"It's the car she drove in ""Eternity Forever""."	I know.  Thank her for me.
Why didn't she thank you?	She did... didn't she?
I love you, Lainey.	I love you too, daddy.
Really?  Too bad.	She thinks you're with Simone.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?	Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?	I do okay.  How about you?
I do okay.  How about you?	You know me -- married to my work.
One thing bothered me.	I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
If anyone asks about Simone --	-- I know, I don't know anything.
-- I know, I don't know anything.	Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
You know, I... don't know.	Is she here tonight?
Is she here tonight?	She can't watch herself.
She still with Kent?	This week anyhow.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.	I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.	It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.	No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.	-- I bet you have.
Nice boat, Taransky.	It's a yacht.
It's a yacht.	I know what you're up to.
I know what you're up to.	I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.	I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
Do I know you?	Max Sayer -- National Echo.
It's a hotel.	I don't understand.
I don't understand.	Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
What do you want -- ?	Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
My God, you've got one?	I will when you're finished writing it.
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.	24-hour tail on Taransky?
Is it a jamming device?	Maybe he's talking to himself.
You could play the lead.	But that's Simone's part.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?	No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Would you like me to read?	Yes, I'd like that.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?	You're in breach.
Let's take it down a notch.	-- What you don't understand --
Simone, are you there?	I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.	I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?	I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
The only real truth is in the work.	You know what I'm talking about.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?	Yes.  Yes, it is.
Good morning, Simone.	Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.	A star is...
Why did you leave me?	I didn't leave you.
Are you calling me?	What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Wow. They called you their son.	We can keep it in the bathroom.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.	Don't step in the horse manure.
Don't go home, okay?	I definitely won't.
I wish I were somewhere else.	Where will you go, where no one has died?
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?	I guess she did.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.	Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
Something happened, didn't it?	Yes, it did.
Yes, it did.	Are you wigging out?
Are you wigging out?	Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.	We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?	No, we're not.
What do you want more than anything?	I don't know.
I don't know.	I told you what I want.
I told you what I want.	I don't know, Cole.
I don't know, Cole.	Why don't you think about it for a while?
What makes you think that?	Your eyes told me.
I didn't know you were funny.	I forgot myself.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.	What about Mrs. Marschal?
What about Mrs. Marschal?	She died a long time ago.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?	I don't tell her a thing.
He hates me.	You hate him?
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.	He your best buddy?
Where should I look then, Cole?	Look over there.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.	Next time I won't be scared of you.
I'm going to see you again, right?	If it's okay with you?
All your soldiers speak Latin?	No, just one.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.	I knew there was a sound explanation.
She wanted me to tell you--	Cole, please stop.
Cole, please stop.	She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
What are you thinking, Momma?	...I don't know.
...I don't know.	You think I'm a freak?
You see ghosts, Cole?	They want me to do things for them.
They want me to do things for them.	They talk to you?
Cole, you're scaring me.	They scare me too sometimes.
Where is she?	Standing next to my window.
A lady. She died.	Oh my God.
I'd give anything to have been there.	I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Don't get mad.	So who moved it?
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.	That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
What are you thinking, Momma?	Lots of things.
Lots of things.	Anything bad about me?
How did you--?	Stop looking at me.
I don't know how else to look--	You're a stuttering Stanley!
...He doesn't get invited places.	It's our pleasure.
Chuck E. who?	Cheese. It's a kid's place.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.	Chicken blood on the crops.
Chicken blood on the crops.	"...Chicken blood? Who said it was... ""chicken blood""?"
Maybe you don't want to remember.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	'Course, it's none of my business.
'Course, it's none of my business.	Let's say today, we make it your business.
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.	How'd he know I'd come?
Could take a little while, though.	"What's a ""little while?"""
"What's a ""little while?"""	Two.. maybe three days.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.	Oh yeah? Why's that?
Oh yeah? Why's that?	You're standing in horseshit.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.	Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.	No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Rod... I have to get back to my job.	Someone actually... employs you?
Someone actually... employs you?	I happen to be a professional.
I happen to be a professional.	Which street corner?
"Let me guess. We're going on a ""long trip""."	Not according to these.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!	Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Get off his case sweetie.	Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Carl, what are you doing?	You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?	Not someone -- Mac.
Looks like the alternator.	Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.	You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!	I thought you said two hundred.
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.	Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
"Wait a second. Did you say ""patricide?"""	Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.	Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!	I could. You sucked.
I could. You sucked.	Hey. Fuck you.
Hey. Fuck you.	Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!	Come out, come out wherever you are!
"""With a hack-hack here --"""	"""And a slash-slash there --"""
"""Old Macdonald... had --"""	"""-- an AXE!"""
Should we be doing this, dude?	Metaphysical question, man.
So... what does it do?	It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.	Manure... is life.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.	Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Well, there goes our record deal.	Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
-- It's not me!	Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Sure. What do you want to know.	People say he was a murderer.
You'll be back.	I don't think so.
This is his room... isn't it?	Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?	I'll be fine here.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.	Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.	-- By way of my breasts?
Throw me one.	Not while you're driving.
What the fuck you talking about, man?	He's right. You were behind.
He started it.	You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.	What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.	Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.	Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Yeah. That's just the problem.	Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
...no... Mac... p-please...	Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Get out of here.	No. Not without you --
Mac... let's get out of here.	Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
What are --	HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!	"-- You're not making sense!! What ""Scarecrow""?"
You wouldn't understand.	You never had trouble communicating before.
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...	Mmmm -- so can I...
"Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... ""Jethro."""	I said that's enough!
What about Jeremiah?	Nah. Just you.
Then why go back now?	Still trying to figure it out myself.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.	Nothing to tell.
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.	What'll we do?
CARL??? Carl did this?!!	Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
-- Where have you two been?	Us? We been... moonlighting.
Like your guitar break.	It's coming right up. After the third verse.
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.	What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.	Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
You took Bill.	It's my nature.
It's my nature.	And this is mine.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.	That wasn't a good night, no.
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.	Starla, it ain't --
What you up to?	Just checking out the lights.
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.	That's not funny.
What the hell are we going to do?!	Just block the doors, any way you can.
He's a fucking Martian?!	A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Where are you?!	We're coming your way, man!
Where's the old half--Mexican?	Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Who's the lucky fella?	Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.	Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.	Hell, I was game!
Sure thing, killer.	What can I do you for?
I loved you. I loved --	Grant, you're sick!
I'll get if for you.	No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Where are you going?	I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?	That's not true -- Where are you--?
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.	Sure you do.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.	It's just a work thing.
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.	Through a wound on his stomach?
Where'd he go?	We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
You got my barley pop?	What do you think?
How much style?	Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?	You paying for the gas?
Last year, this was a new rig.	But it wasn't a Kenworth.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?	Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
See ya, Bandit.	See ya, Kate.
What are you thinking?	You gotta admire the man's determination.
He's just exhausted.	That man is your father?!?
What can I say?	Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.	Well, thanks for the lift.
One to five?	Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
What are you gonna do when you get home?	Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
What kind of a guy is he?	The minute you see him, you'll know.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.	You take the front, I'll take the back.
An unmarked police car.	How do you know?
How do you know?	I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?	No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Let's hit it.	Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
Mississippi's the other way!	You want to lose this putz or not?!?
You could've asked.	You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
By stealing my car?	I would've come back for you.
What the hell are you doing?!?	He's after us again!
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.	I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
You know, you're not a bad driver.	You know, you're not a bad passenger.
I give up.	You just passed your nemesis.
Driving, talking to me...	They're both a challenge.
They're both a challenge.	You have a great profile.
You have a great profile.	Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Why're you driving so fast?	I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.	Why? You have a bowling date?
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?	For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.	A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.	It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.	But you could get killed, right?
But you could get killed, right?	Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
But you'll do it?	I'll do it.
I'll do it.	I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.	You sure do.
What's your pleasure?	Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
You're coming up to the scale house.	I'm cucumber cool.
Talk to me.	We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
-- How we doing?	It's gonna be close. Real close.
Just fine. What's the weather like?	God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
We're outta motion lotion.	I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
Never mind. It's nothing.	Anything else you don't want me to know?
Anything else you don't want me to know?	Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
I ran into complications.	I hate to say it...
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?	Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.	I'm at marker eight-five.
I'm at marker eight-five.	Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?	Do I have a choice?
Do I have a choice?	What's your twenty?
What's your twenty?	'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?	If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.	What's your twenty?
What's your twenty?	I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.	Not for long, you ain't.
You can't swear on these.	What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
Bandit I, do you copy?	This is Bandit I, come back.
I hate to say I told you so.	Save it. We got a long haul.
Save it. We got a long haul.	Clear and rolling.
We still on schedule?	Forty-two minutes ahead.
Let's get the hell outta here.	Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
You know how to drive one of these things?	Can a pig whistle?
Shit! No one's here.	That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.	Let's keep it that way.
Loud and clear.	Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Why are we doing this?	Because they said it couldn't be done.
Six. Got it.	If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.	Twenty-one is nineteen.
Twenty-one is nineteen.	If I say go to two, it's really one.
How long's this gonna take?	I don't know, man. Ask him?
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.	Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?	How'd you know?
Pick it up, Breaker.	Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.	What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Go head on, breaker.	I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.	What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Have any trouble getting here?	About one to five years worth.

Are you a fucking colossal idiot?	I am. Yeah.
Do you want me to say I did it?	I was kinda hoping, yeah.
I was kinda hoping, yeah.	Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?	Only if you really, truly mean it.

I said I got his machine.	No, what did you say on the machine?
No, what did you say on the machine?	I left him a message.

No... We're trying to save Heller.	...So you knew all this and yet y--
...So you knew all this and yet y--	-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
...So you made another deal?	I wouldn't go that far.
...Are you insane?	"...Almost.  What do you mean ""who Sparazza actually was..."""
...Does he know?	...He does now...
I can't discuss --	-- You can and you will.
What are you doing here?	My debrief --
My debrief --	-- will be handled back in --

Like a mafucka.	That takes some of the sting out.
What were you doin' here anyway?	'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.	Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
I can trust Rheya.	You'll end up like me.
You'll end up like me.	You're not Gibarian...
You're not Gibarian...	No?  Who am I, then?
She'll come back.	No, she won't.
No, she won't.	Why would you let her to do that?
You fucking bastard...	Whose side are you on?
You killed her!	Not her.  It.
No.  There's no behavior modification.	She reappeared exactly as she had before?
What happened to Gibarian?	Didn't you talk to Snow?
Didn't you talk to Snow?	I want to hear your version.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.	Where's his body?
Where's his body?	In the lab.  With her, probably.
In the lab.  With her, probably.	Her?  Who are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.	I won't be making the trip.
What do you want?	I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Her oxygen would have run out.	Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
They come when you sleep.	That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
Perhaps it did.	Human beings can die.
Kelvin, you awake?	What is it?
What are you going to report back to Earth?	I don't know.
I wish you'd told me.	Told you what?
How much sleep do you need?	How much sleep?
How much sleep?	How long can you go without sleep?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.	Oh, that's a relief.
Is there anybody else here?	Why, who did you see?
Why, who did you see?	Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.	Who was it?
Who was it?	She was real.  Where did she come from?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.	He'll let me in.
He'll let me in.	Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
What does it want?	I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
What are you taking?	A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
Is that really what you want?	I want to stop taking those pills.
I want to stop taking those pills.	I wish you wouldn't.
Am I really her?	I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
What do I have to do to stop it?	I want you here.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.	That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.	Who are you, then?
You should have told me.	It wouldn't have made any difference.
Neither did I.	You never said you wanted one.
You never said you wanted one.	I never said I didn't.
I can't stay here.	Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.	Then you won't make it.
Then you'll die.	I want every second I can get with you.
What's happening to us?	It's all right.
Gibarian.  He was here.	You said he was dead.
You said he was dead.	He is.  But he was here...
But that's what happened before.	Not this time.
You're the coward.	Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
But we fought.	Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.	Why did she do it?
Why did she do it?	You... she said I didn't love her.
You... she said I didn't love her.	Was she right?
Was she right?	No.  I love you.
No.  I love you.	I love you, too.
Do I really feel like... I am...?	Yes.  Yes.
"You sure say ""God"" a lot when we're doing it."	I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
What happened to us, exactly?	You don't know?
Where've you been?	I been thinking about how much I hate you.
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.	As I said, then it's God, right?
Is it intelligent?	Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.	Then it's God, right?
What do you remember?	What do you mean?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.	Rheya.  Not here.
Let's go home.	You go home.
Not a very happy poem.	You didn't look very happy.
What are they?	To calm your anxiety.
To calm your anxiety.	To calm my anxiety.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.	I'll be right back.
I need to see Snow.	I'll go with you.
I'll go with you.	I'll just be a minute.
Snow, get up here, now.	I'm not Snow.
Followed by non-human manifestations.	Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
He won't do it.	Why do you say that?
It's terrific Win.	You still writing the occasional magazine article?
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.	And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?	You didn't like him?
You didn't like him?	Looks a little constipated to me.
Say goodbye, Mike.	You take care.
I like your coat.	You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
I'll miss you, Mike.	Listen, I'll... see you again.
You still going away?	I don't know...
I don't know...	You don't have to, now.
You don't have to, now.	I think it's probably still a good idea.
Everyone's all right...?	Yeah.  It's all over.
I'd miss my life...	... Don't explain.
What a memory.	Do you dance?
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?	I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Oh that thing in Queens.	I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Oh God, that's great!	Are you okay?
What do you want to do?	I don't know.
I don't know you...	This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
They called here after you left...	She's okay.  Everything's okay...
Stop being nuts!	I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!	I do care about you!
What do you want?	Open the door, will you?
Open the door, will you?	I can't open it.
"It was nice having you ""watch over me""..."	Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
What about Neil?	You don't like him, do you?
You don't like him, do you?	What's to like?
What's to like?	Tell it like it is.
You could do better.	I'll miss you, Mike...
"So it was ""love""."	Yeah.  It was.
So, this could be your last night, huh?	Could be, I guess.
Didn't do very well, did you?	Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.	You were reading my Renoir.
You were reading my Renoir.	How did you know?
Urdu and Hindi.	Yeah, what a woman.
Sooner, the better.	He said he'd kill me.
He said he'd kill me.	Big talk... Desperate guy.
I'm sorry about what happened.	Listen, that was my fault.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.	I came on at 8:00.
I'll come with you.	I think I can probably do that on my own.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.	Let's get a drink.
Let's get a drink.	Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
You can touch me, I won't bite.	Not too sure about that.
Put it on my account, please.	I got money.
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.	Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
You live in Manhattan?	Queens... You know Queens?
Right.  That's true.	Can we go then?
Can we go then?	I'm supposed to call in.
I'm supposed to call in.	There's a phone in the car.
I've never seen anyone killed before.	It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.	It was something my father always liked me to do.
It was something my father always liked me to do.	You're planning to speak?
You're planning to speak?	Not if you don't want me to.
Not if you don't want me to.	Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...	Just putting in an appearance then.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...	Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --	And I'm making mine.
... just saying you should think twice about it...	... I don't want to talk about it...
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?	I don't know Tommy.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?	Sure we are, let's go!
What did you do tonight?	I watched TV.
I watched TV.	What did you watch?
"D'you have to say ""fucking"" every other word?"	What was that?
What was that?	You heard me.
You heard me.	Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.	What're you talking about --
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!	Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?	Did you hear what I said?!!
Coming to bed?	Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
It's not your taste.	What did she say the down payment was?
She took you shopping for a tie?	I had to follow her to a store.
I had to follow her to a store.	What's wrong with your paisley tie?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?	Ellie, it was a formal party...
Ellie, it was a formal party...	Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?	I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?	Where'd you get the tie?
I think -- she's crazy.	I'd identify him.
I'd identify him.	I might stop you.
Oh, some shit.	What shit, honey?
What shit, honey?	You don't want to hear about it.
Hey.  The neighbors.	Let 'em eat their hearts out.
I think television's a dangerous thing.	It's twenty bucks in the bank.
I can still use a gun.	Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?	You got no idea...
You got no idea...	Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
My ass is falling.  It is.	What are you talking about?
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.	Take my advice, don't buy any...
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?	It should've been me...
At my house...!	Call a cruiser!
Tell me I'm dreamin'.	I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Wasn't your fault.	It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
You in this with me?	Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.	Ever shot anyone?
You're here 'til what time?	I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
I asked for the man in charge...	That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Watch your step!	What the fuck you doin'?!
Let my kid go.	I'm not lettin' no one go.
Why should she come in?	She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.	Bullshit!  Prove it.
You should'a brought the girl.	I brought the girl.  She's outside.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.	I don't think she can sing, either.
I don't think she can sing, either.	Take care, pal.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?	We're gonna pass the street.
How are things going, pal?	Okay, I guess.
Okay, I guess.	How about dinner tonight?
How about dinner tonight?	Mom and I got plans.
Mom and I got plans.	"What ""plans?""  You and Mom got ""plans?"""
"What ""plans?""  You and Mom got ""plans?"""	She's taking singing lessons.
Nice threads Dad.	Yeah, I think so.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!	"Just ""lay back, Mack""... lay back..."

What're we having?	My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.	Scrambled eggs surprise?
Peter-- you took this picture?	Let me see.
Well, look who's dressing for success.	At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Remember Little League?	Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
So, uh... how's college goin'?	Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Here you go, Pete.	Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--	What, want a glass?
What, want a glass?	No. No, that's okay.
Flash, get lost.	Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!	Hm.  What a lump.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--	I'm parked illegally!
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.	Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...	Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
You get mugged or something?	Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--	I got you a present.
"""Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."""	I know.  I've got one too.
What's in there?	A little bunny I saved from dissection.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.	They'll never take me alive.
Are you okay?	Get away from me, freak!
Now tell me you love me.	Lemme down, bugface!
Lemme down, bugface!	That's not even close.
Can I get a word in edgewise?	No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?	Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.	Can we make it a hundred?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.	I think you're trying to tell me something.
Would you cool it already?	Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.	How about tomorrow?
How about tomorrow?	You're making my life difficult.
You're making my life difficult.	Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?	An even five I throw in the jacket.
What's this? A cockaroach?	A spider.  Eight legs.
Are you quite finished?	Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
Just call me Spidey.	Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?	Thanks, I already ate.
Some things you should say anyway.	Even if they're not clever.
What if you get hurt?	What if the world ends tomorrow?
May's much better. She'll be out soon.	Oh, God, I forgot to--
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.	Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?	Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Do you mind if I come too?	I think I'd like that.
Sit down and stop being such a child.	This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.	That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
What's your problem?	I've got no problems.
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.	I'm sure you kept warm.
What are you doing this weekend?	I've gotta study.
I've gotta study.	Oh. Maybe I should, too--
God, Flash can be such a jerk.	But you like that in a man?
But you like that in a man?	You should write that one down.
Some prep school thing.	Does it have a human name?
I'd never admit that.	Hurry up, Flash!
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.	Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.	I hate people with alliterative names.
Uh is a good start.	I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Good morning, Liz.	How very dull, Peter Parker.
How very dull, Peter Parker.	It's too early to be clever.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?	Precise equipment such as waldos

I'll introduce you.	Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--	I'm a photographer, remember?
There's nothing in there worth stealing!	That's the understatement of the year.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.	Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...	You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Creation? Or its opposite?	Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
No.  No thank you.  I have work.	I heard about Thorkel's order--
I heard about Thorkel's order--	I left a paper in my desk.
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.	Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.

Up here, Docky Ocky!	No, no!  Not there!
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?	Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.	I'm not so happy myself.
Loonytunes.  And yet...	Just drop me off here.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.	They never caught on.
They never caught on.	They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?	Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?	Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Just pulled the old match gag, see!	What's the match gag?
We made a deal with Barrack One.	Any news on Dunbar?
Any news on Dunbar?	He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.	Looks good outside.
There's only one pair left.	We'll get some more.
And maybe a little something else?	A little something what?
Then we're all in on it?	Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Break it off!	How much more do we have to take from him?
How much more do we have to take from him?	There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.

I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.	You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.	What is your number?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.	I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --

What do they always say?	That's what I wanna hear.
That's what I wanna hear.	It's not good for you, Animal.
To the Brick Kremlin!	She'll never forgive me!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!	So what? There's other women!
So what? There's other women!	Not for me! Betty! Betty!
You'll fix me up!	Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!	He's the grrrrreatest!

What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!	Me? What if she don't want me?
Me? What if she don't want me?	If she don't want you, she don't get anything.

Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?	Why do you do this to me every morning?
Shut up, Animal!	Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.	Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.	Why the south latrine?
Why the south latrine?	Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
We've all done a poor job of it.	I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?	Any objections, men?
What about Schulz?	We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
Los, los. Dummkopf!	Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
You could use a new one yourself.	Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
How do they know?	You told them, Hoffy.
You off your rocker?	Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
You heard that, Sefton?	Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?	We did it.
We did it.	There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
Stay out of it, Sefton.	Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.	Nothing for Kuzawa?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.	Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?	Are you questioning me?
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?	Ich weiss alles.
Ich weiss alles.	Wie hat er's gemacht?
Wie hat er's gemacht?	Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Schulz, you're off your nut!	Give me the radio.
Give me the radio.	We have no radio.
Talk what? I do not know anything!	How many do you want? A thousand?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?	Who's the guy, Schulz?
I do not want those cigarettes.	Yes, you do!
This is me in Cincinnati.	Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?	That is my wife.
That is my wife.	Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!	Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?	Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.	Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.	Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
You heard him.	Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
So you're stuck with me, eh?	Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Have a nice time over there?	Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Is it all right if we smell it?	Just don't drool on it.
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.	We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.	I have to find a way to get to Soran.
This is its current position.	Can you project its course?
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!	One minute to warp core breach.
Data, are you all right?	I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.	It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I get it. I get it.	You get what?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.	Really? What do you feel?
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.	The station complement was nineteen.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.	I'll go. You have the Bridge.
We're within range, sir.	Beam them directly to Sickbay.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?	Why would you want to leave?
Yes, where would you go?	I don't understand.
All of us.	Where is he now?
Where is he now?	Wherever he wanted to be.
This is the Nexus?	For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?	You're in the Nexus.
We don't have a tractor beam.	You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
No, no. Thank you.	Please, I insist.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.	Oh, of course.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?	Yes.  Thank you.
Yes.  Thank you.	Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
Close to retirement?	I hadn't planned on it.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-	Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.	I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Beautiful day, isn't it?	Yes, yes, it is.
Keep her together until I get back.	I always do.
But I do have a theory...	I thought you might.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.	And what would that be, sir?
And what would that be, sir?	Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.	What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?	Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
That's a pretty big margin of error.	Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Understood. That will be all.	Sir, is there anything wrong?
Sir, is there anything wrong?	No. Thank you.
You want me to contact Starfleet?	Is there a problem?
Or perhaps they're on the surface.	Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Captain, are you all right?	Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
You must think I'm quite the madman.	The thought had crossed my mind.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.	Lock phasers and return fire!
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.	Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
It looks like we're too late.	There are no other ships in the system.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...	And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!	Tractor beam, aye!
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?	Soon, Captain... Quite soon.
Put me on the hailing frequency.	Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.	Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
What did you see, Chekov?	For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Still no response, sir.	Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
You did great, Bones... Just great.	Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.	Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?	Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Aye sir, coding now.	Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
I don't believe it...	What is it?
Hello, sir. It's David.	David... Sorry I'm late.
David!... What went wrong?	I went wrong.
This planet is aging in surges.	And Spock with it. They are joined together.
It was the only way to solve certain problems --	Did your collaborator know?
You mean, we're stranded down here?!	Logic indicates that is the case.
That may be difficult...	Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!	I have already made one transmission too many...
Later. Let's go...	Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
What is it?	Spock's burial robe.
I'll handle that later.	My readings indicate great instability.
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...	Short range scan.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.	... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...	A photon tube...!
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.	There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...	Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
How many more?	Just him, sir!
Just him, sir!	Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.	Scan for vessels in pursuit!
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.	Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.	What? What are you saying?
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?	. He will remain always as he is.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.	Saavik... Is... David with you?
Yes, yes, Spock...	The ship... Out of danger...?
I know you... Do I not?	Yes. And I know you.
You would have done the same for me.	Why would you do this...?
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.	It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.	Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
We are clear and free to navigate.	Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...	What about surface life signs...?
What about surface life signs...?	Close... There --
About a dozen officers and men.	With some on the planet...
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!	Fire, Mr. Scott!
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?	I think it's an energy form, sir...
I think it's an energy form, sir...	Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?	... A cloaking device?
... A cloaking device?	Red alert, Mr. Scott.
See! That shimmering area.	Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.	Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.	Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...	Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
... We have cleared Spacedoors.	FULL IMPULSE POWER!
The word, sir?	The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.	Count on our help, sir.
Count on our help, sir.	I'll need it, Sulu.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?	She's to be decommissioned.
Gentlemen. Good evening.	Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?	Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Would you look at that?	My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.	Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?	No, sir, no response.
No, sir, no response.	Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.	Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Welcome aboard, Admiral.	Welcome home, Jim.
Genesis, I want it.	Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.	Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!	If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!	Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...	You should take the Vulcan, too.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.	No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
What I have done, I had to do.	But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.	What must I do?
Yes... But -- how...?	Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
... The needs of the many outweigh...	... The needs of the few...
... The needs of the few...	... Or the one.
He would not have spoken of it openly.	Then, how --
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.	They know we would die first.
I ordered no interruptions.	But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
Share this with no one.	Understood, my lord.
So!  Speak!	Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.	Put him on screen!  Study him well.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.	Steady. Continue on impulse power.
Good for you, Lieutenant.	But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?	This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
You amaze me, Commander.	How is that...?
You're not going in there -- !	I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?	Young. I feel young, Doctor.
Now that's what I call a meal.	It's like the Garden of Eden...
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?	Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?	The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
And who am I hiding from?	From yourself, Admiral.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --	Say thank you.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.	Exactly. Happy birthday.
Physician, heal thyself.	That's all you have to say?
That's all you have to say?	I'm not a drama critic.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --	I have my orders.
Is that a poem?	Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
Jim... read me? Can you read me?	Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?	... Can't read you... repeat...
... Can't read you... repeat...	Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?	... taking Genesis away from us...
... taking Genesis away from us...	Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?	... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?	What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Go back. I'm going to kill him.	You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
But the child --	Never mind! Hurry!
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!	What's the matter -- ?
You're crazy -- !	I saw it -- !
I saw it -- !	There's an air-lock.
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.	Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.	Is that what you came here to say?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.	I didn't expect anything.
I'm trying, David.	So am I. My friends were killed, too.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.	I am truly sorry.
I don't mean to intrude.	Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.	Are you running away from me?
He's on a build up to detonation!	How soon --
How soon --	We encoded four minutes --
We encoded four minutes --	We'll beam aboard and stop it --
It's a long story.	We appear to have plenty of time.
Why didn't you tell me?	She's making it up! My father was Professor --
Where's Dr. Marcus --	I'm Doctor Marcus!
What are <u>you</u> looking at?	I don't know.
What are you looking at?	The Admiral's son.
The Admiral's son.	Don't you believe it.
Don't you believe it.	Oh, I believe it.
Let go -- he can't -- !	Only half of you would get there.
Yours... is... the superior...	I shall avenge you --
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --	<u>Full power damn you</u>!
They won't --	<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Sir -- our shields are dropping!	Raise them --
They're requesting visual communications, sir.	Let them eat static.
Let them eat static.	They're still running with shields down.
Time's up, Admiral...	Here it comes. Now, Spock.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.	Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Just barely, sir.	I'm going down to the station.
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?	A few shots, sir.
We'll be going to warp speed --	Aye, sir --
Mr. Scott on discrete.	Scotty, let's have it.
She's not responding...	Try the emergency channels...
Try the emergency channels...	Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.	Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Uhura. Can't you augment?	I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!	He'll die -- !
Midshipman, you're a tiger.	My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Give the word, Admiral.	Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?	Not at present.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.	Admiral, this is Spock.
Is the word given?	The word is given: warp speed.
And who is this?	Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
... the good of the few...	Or the one.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.	Uhura, patch me in --
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.	Steady as you go...
What IS working around here?	Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.	A distinct possibility.
The prefix code?	It's all we've got.
Not enough against their shields.	Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
They knew just where to hit us.	WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?	One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.	Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --	Too late --
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?	It would explain a great many things --
What's she doing here?	Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
It literally is Genesis...	The power of creation --
The power of creation --	Have they proceeded with their experiments?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.	To be sure, Captain.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...	Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...	Aye, sir --
Admiral on the bridge!	As you were, Mr. Saavik.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.	Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.	Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Three minutes, thirty seconds.	Distance from Reliant...
Time from my mark...	Two minutes, ten seconds.
Two minutes, ten seconds.	Engine room! What's happening?!
Cease fire. Look sharp.	Power levels quite low, sir.
Power levels quite low, sir.	Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
Mr. Saavik, all stop.	All stop, sir.
All stop, sir.	Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
That was close --	They just don't want us going in there.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'	'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?	The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
Indeterminate life signs.	Phasers on stun. Move out.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.	Energize defense fields.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.	You earned it.
You earned it.	I did not think so.
I did not think so.	You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.	I failed to resolve the situation.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?	You may ask, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?	It is still regulation, Admiral.
And why not?	Because... there was no way to win.
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.	Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...	Engage warp engines --
We are clear and free to navigate.	Course heading, Captain?
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.	Aft thrusters, sir.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.	... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.	Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
All moorings are clear, Captain.	Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
He's not what I expected, Sir.	What did you expect, Lieutenant?
What did you expect, Lieutenant?	He's very human.
Fire all phasers...!	No power to the weapons system, sir.
I do not understand the final question...	You are half human. The Computer knows that.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.	The question is irrelevant.
Where must you go?	To Earth. To offer testimony.
To Earth. To offer testimony.	You do this -- for friendship?
You do this -- for friendship?	I do this because I was there,
Humans make illogical decisions...	... They do, indeed.
How're you doing?	Fine. Just fine.
Heard there was some excitement.	Just a couple of kooks...
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?	A moment alone, please.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.	Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.	Not me, Bones... They did it.
Wake up, man, wake up!	Come on, Pavel...
An experimental device, doctor.	Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
You sure this is such a bright idea?	What do you mean?
It'll come back to him.	Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.	Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Naturally.  So what is your problem?	Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.	Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.	... Best shot...?
... Best shot...?	Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.	"""Guessing"" is not in my nature..."
"""Guessing"" is not in my nature..."	Well nobody's perfect...
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.	Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Fundoscopic examination --	Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
What the hell do you think you're doing?	Reading the patient's vital signs.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.	We're just -- observing.
We're just -- observing.	I was not informed about observers.
Can you isolate the wave?	Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
I have the coordinates of the reactor...	... It gives me a great sense of history.
Go ahead. Stun me.	I'm wery sorry, but --
All right. Let's take it from the top.	The top of what?
No, <u>my</u> name.	I do not know your name.
I do not know your name.	You play games with me and you're through
You play games with me and you're through	I am? May I go now?
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.	Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.	Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Ah, well done, team 2.	And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.	Understood. What is your plan?
No choice now, Scotty!	Sir, heat shields at maximum!
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.	That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Can you protect us?	We are launching everything we have.
You sure you won't change your mind?	Is there something wrong with the one I have?
So you were at Berkeley.	I was not.
I suppose they told you that...?	The hell they did.
Attempting the hell to communicate.	Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
You mean this is -- goodbye?	Why does it have to be goodbye?
Oh my God, we're too late!	Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
You tricked me.	You need me.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.	What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.	You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.	What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.	Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!	Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?	A spaceship with a missing man.
Steady, now. We need your help.	Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.	So. There we are.
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.	No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
All right. The truth?	I'm all ears.
Wanna try it from the top?	Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?	... Who are you?
... Who are you?	Who do you think I am?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.	What do you mean now?
Just lucky, I guess.	You're upset about losing the whales.
You're upset about losing the whales.	... You're very perceptive.
... You're very perceptive.	How will that be done, exactly?
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.	How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
Or believe, I'll bet.	Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.	Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.	What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
Memory problems, too.	Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.	I buy that. What about him?
We don't want to be any trouble.	You've already been that. C'mon.
Spock: Condition report!	No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?	They did, Admiral.
They did, Admiral.	Then... Where the hell are we?
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?	No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.	Right.  Will you help us?
Admiral. Full power is restored.	Thank you, Spock.
I cannot tell a lie.	You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?	The hell I can't
The hell I can't	What else did you learn from your mind meld?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.	... I see.
How do you know this...?	... Simple logic.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.	Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.	What is our target in time?
What is our target in time?	The late 20th Century.
The late 20th Century.	Surely you can be more specific...
Mr. Spock, your computations?	In progress, Admiral.
In progress, Admiral.	Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?	The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
Where are you going?!	To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
Thank you, Admiral.	Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --	Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.	Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.	Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.	Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!	... Aye sir...?
... Aye sir...?	What is our condition?
What is our condition?	Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...	Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!	Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...	Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
Warp two... three...	Steady as she goes...
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.	Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
I can't, sir -- Nothing!	Out of control, and blind as a bat!
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.	Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Estimate range, ship to whales!	Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.	Put them on screen!
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...	Everyone remember where we parked.
What is it?	Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
No power to the bay doors.	The explosive override -- ?
The explosive override -- ?	It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...	Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!	Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Full power, sir.	Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...	How long, Scotty?
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?	Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.	Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.	Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.	Humpbacked - people.?
Scotty, how long is this bay?	About 60 feet, Admiral.
I am well, Admiral.	You will be in good hands here.
Just use the keyboard...	The keyboard... How quaint.
I notice you're still working with polymers.	Sill? What else would I be working with?
Well, that's different.	If you'll follow me, Professor --
If you'll follow me, Professor --	I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Professor Scott, if you'll --	I demand to see the owners! I demand --
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?	Right on. You fly?
Mother and son. You arranged this...?	I thought it might begin the healing process.
... an offlander?	For someone so young.
But not you.	There are days.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.	Then you must spend your life answering questions.
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...	No... I want to stay with you...
No... I want to stay with you...	It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?	Androids... don't have...fun.
Don't you ever get tired?	My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Can he breathe under water?	Data doesn't breathe.
Data doesn't breathe.	Won't he rust?
Is it safe to move her?	Safer than leaving her here.
Will he live?	Yes. But look at this medscan...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...	They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...	Will the structure hold if we blast through?
Will the structure hold if we blast through?	I believe it is safe, sir.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...	Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.	'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
Yes... that looks like them.	What's the last thing you remember, Data...
What's the last thing you remember, Data...	'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'	From the mission...
It is not over.	It is over.
I'll order Riker to turn around.	Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
You're not finished here?	Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?	... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
May I talk to you alone?	Deploy the collector.
Implants bothering you?	It's nothing. I'm just tired.
I don't believe it happened that way.	Why would they fire at him without provocation?
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.	Do you have everything you need from command?
Will that stop the tear?	You got me, Commander.
You got me, Commander.	That's your expert opinion?
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...	It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...	Eject the core.
They're powering their forward weapons array.	Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.	We're through running from these bastards.
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...	Remind me to lodge a protest...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.	How long 'til they reach us?
You must be planning on doing some hunting.	Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...	We're not going anywhere.
My name is Sojef, Captain.	Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.	Would you like something to eat?
Would you like something to eat?	No, we're here to... rescue them.
Worf to Picard...	Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...	We're trying to get to you, sir...
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.	Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
One. It's Ru'afo.	Can you beam him off?
Can you beam him off?	Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...	Is there any other way to disable the injector?
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.	Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.	We have to find shelter...
You need a haircut, Commander.	Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?	No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...	Picard to Crusher...
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!	Transferring controls to manual.
Scanners are off line!	Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...	Beam him out!
... Population three hundred million...	Say the greeting again...
Say the greeting again...	Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...	... I believe you...
... I believe you...	... I'm not sleeping well...
... I'm not sleeping well...	... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...	But it's comfortable.
But it's comfortable.	Why don't you try sitting up?
Why don't you try sitting up?	Or you could try lying down.
Or you could try lying down.	You're in quite a mood today.
What you're doing to my neck...	Was I doing something to your neck?
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...	Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
What are they interested in...?	Wine, women and song.
Wine, women and song.	You should feel right at home with them.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.	All ship functions are off-line.
Initiate launch sequence.	Activating injector assembly.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.	I look forward to reading your report.
Good hunting. Hayes out.	Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
You actually performed surgery...?	It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
How long has he been unconscious?	At least four hours.
Can you configure it?	I believe so.
Isn't it better like this...?	Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...	... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
I do not know what you are referring to.	That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?	Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
What year is it?	According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.	Contact Starfleet Command.
I have helm control.	Where's the Sphere?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.	Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Who are you?	I am the Borg.
What did you do to the batteries?	Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?	I told you, there's no --
"""APR cell count?"" What the hell are you talking about?"	Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?	We're crossing the threshold!
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.	As they used to say... all systems are go.
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...	Altitude fifty kilometers...
Altitude fifty kilometers...	Entering the upper ionospere...
Entering the upper ionospere...	There's a red light on the second intake valve.
No... the door's too thick.	Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...	What's still there?
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.	It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...	I have the password right here.
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.	There should be an access hatch nearby...
This must be it.	How serious is the damage?
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...	I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
There is no invasion...	Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
What do you want?	The invasion plans.
You seem to have an answer for everything.	Something wrong with that?
Where are you from most recently?	California. San Francisco.
Where in the States?	Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
You're leaving, aren't you?	I have to...
I have to...	Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...	No. It's a lot further than that.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.	Friends from Cornell...
Were the two of you... involved?	No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.	How did you know about that?
"""Money."" So you can get dome money..."	I can try.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --	Thank God this plate was already fixed.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.	Yes, he is.
Track their weapons fire.	Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...	Steady as she goes.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?	Unless you'd like to stay.
Good luck, sir.	I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Are you alright?	Just a little queasy...
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.	The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...	They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...	Computer -- thermal enhancement.
What are they doing?	They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
I remember it made me sick.	What are you suggesting?
They're bypassing Engineering...	Where the hell are they going?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?	Commander... we have a problem.
Worf? Is something wrong?	Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Or not to be -	That's the question -
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...	Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
Spock, that was actually funny.	We DO sleep lying down.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...	Vulcans sleep lying down...
I believe the operation is over.	The charge is murder.
Good luck, Captain.	I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.	To be -
Damned clever if you ask me...	Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
If they're even looking for us...	Spock's looking for us...
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...	No way.  You see this?
What is it with you, anyway?	Still think we're finished?
Still think we're finished?	More than ever.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...	Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Bones, are you afraid of the future?	That was the general idea I intended to convey.
That was the general idea I intended to convey.	I didn't mean this future.
I didn't mean this future.	Are we playing multiple choice?
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.	We're not finished.
We're not finished.	Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
Can you - ?	Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
What the Hell's going on?	I wish I knew. Uhura?
Too bad we can't SMELL her.	In space, no one can hear you sweat.
This is fun...	Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?	Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
Are you carrying a surgeon?	We were until your torpedoes!
We were until your torpedoes!	Then let me help!
They'll respect him now...	That's a comfort...
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?	Well, I -
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.	Those words WERE spoken by me.
I checked the data banks, yes.	And what did they tell you?
And what did they tell you?	That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
He just tried to save him!	Take them away.
He's a DOCTOR!	How can I trust --
My God, what happened here?	You feign ignorance?
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.	I'm not sure how to take that.
Shields. Battle stations.	Shields up. Battle stations.
She's here - somewhere.	But if she's cloaked...
Just the size of my head -	I know what you mean...
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??	Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
Where is Mr. Sulu?	Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.	Now we go to Starfleet?
Now we go to Starfleet?	Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?	You tell them, Lieutenant.
They're preparing to fire.	Shields up, Captain --?
Do we report this, sir?	Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.	We must do this again soon.
What took you so long?	Kill him! He's the one!!
Kill him! He's the one!!	Not me, idiot - HIM!
Isn't it about time you became something else?	I like it here...
Your friends are late...	They'll be here...
I know how to get outside the shield.	Where do we come in?
We don't get many presidential assassins.	We didn't kill Gorkon.
How did you know...?	There's a reward for your death.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.	He's got it.
He's got it.	And your coat.
And your coat.	Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Stand down your weapons.	Captain, if --
Captain, if --	Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Just the prototype.	You hear that?
Captain, our shields -- !	Uhura, signal our surrender.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...	Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -	I always wanted to try that.
I always wanted to try that.	Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Aft thrusters -	Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
When does this conference start?	According to my information, today.
According to my information, today.	Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.	Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...	... is to trust him.
Close enough to beam down?	Not yet... Section 4236...
But I am not human. I am only -	Spock, you want to know something?
Why would they give them to us?	The Commander is an old friend of yours.
The peace conference.	What peace conference?
We HAVEN'T fired -	According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
What the -	We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
What is it?	I am uncertain.
I am uncertain.	Spock, I'm really tired...
Spock, I'm really tired...	We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Never been this close.	The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -	DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.	You have personally -
Channel open, Captain.	This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
Control tower, reading, Sir.	Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
If you are logical.	I don't want to.
I don't want to.	I believe you. Please...
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.	Not as yet, sir.
Her own father...?	Such things have happened before, sir.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...	What is it?
What is it?	... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.	Aye, aye, sir.
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!	This one can.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.	Not from us!
A computer canna lie, sir.	I think  not.
I think  not.	You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -	We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.	That could take hours!
And if they're still in place?	Then someone forged a data bank entry.
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.	Maybe we should write them a letter?
No. Can I move now?	No. I must deactivate you.
No. I must deactivate you.	For how long?
Brother. I cannot move.	No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Do you know where you are?	I am in a room with lights.
Do you know who I am?	You are me.
You are me.	No. My name is Data... I am your brother.
Fuzzy face is gone.	Yes, please continue.
Not tonight, I have work here.	Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
Beverly, come in.	You're working late.
We are being hailed.	Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.	Divert power and compensate.
We are losing dorsal shields.	Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?	Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.	Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
What do you imagine this is?	Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?	There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
A bit less florid, Data.	Aye, sir... This way.
He is very observant.	I can see that.
Now, you make a toast.	To new worlds...
To new worlds...	New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
So... To happy endings.	To happy endings.
You have a red shirt.	This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?	I thought only me, myself and Lore.
It appears to be...  ... an arm.	Why is it moving?
Why is it moving?	Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
But how can he? He'll kill you.	This isn't about me anymore.
How can you be certain?	I know how he thinks.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?	I don't know.
I'm going to miss you.	And I you.
Do you have a moment, sir?	Of course, sit down.
May I have this dance?	With pleasure, Captain.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.	You sick bastard!
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.	Do you have life support?
I'll take care of it, sir.	Number One.  You have the bridge.
How long until he can fire?	The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
What's he doing?	He wants to look me in the eye.
Just lucky, Admiral.	Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
So, human... you've met your better self!	What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.	Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.	On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.	Who was it?
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.	Not yet, Mister Worf.
To find the head, sir?	If you don't mind.
I won't do it.	Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Serving with you has been an honor.	The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
Strength in numbers?	We can only hope so.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.	And the Romulans invade.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.	Can anything be done for him?
Not very chatty.	Away team. Transporter room four.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.	She's a predator.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.	A coup d'etat?
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.	Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
I don't know.	But you want to.
What's this all about?	It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...	You're not Reman.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.	I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
Hello, Jean Luc.	Why am I here?
Why am I here?	I was lonely...
So I'm not as tall as you expected?	I always hoped I would hit two meters.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.	With a full head of hair.
With a full head of hair.	There is that.
After you, Praetor.	Age before rank, Jean Luc.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...	Were we always explorers?
You don't trust me.	I have no reason to.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?	No race should be a slave to another.
It's not quite the face you remember.	Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.	You'll acquire a taste for it.
And the Senate supports you?	I have dissolved the Senate.
What about Picard?	Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.	But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
Target disruptors. Destroy them.	Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.	On my way.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.	We're being hailed.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.	Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
So theyve got him up and running.	He's a very unusual android.
He's a very unusual android.	Runs in the family.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.	It is... invigorating.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!	She is here.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.	Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
The bond is broken.	Find her again.
Find her again.	No -- this is wasting time.
No -- this is wasting time.	Do as I tell you!
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!	You don't have to understand.
I have a purpose.	Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?	I don't think so...
I don't think so...	Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
Don't you think you should call a backup?	No, we can handle this.
Right in line with that burning tree.	I don't see anything.
Benny, God, take it easy...	I don't want to scare them away.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?	We should have. Let me see.
I'll have to run your card off now.	We're only going to be here a few hours...
We're only going to be here a few hours...	It's still the full price.
What can I do for you folks?	How much are your rooms?
How much are your rooms?	Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
What do you think of America?	It is beautiful.
What do you do?	I make maps.
I make maps.	Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Where did you stop last?	What the hell do you think you're doing?
What the hell do you think you're doing?	Where did you stop last?
Where did you stop last?	Stay right there...
Stay right there...	What was your last stop?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.	They must have picked it up in space.
What's all this for?	We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
That's the chance we have to take.	No, we don't.
No, we don't.	Then you're going to have to do it without me.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.	I don't like it, George...
I don't like it, George...	Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
Why did you let it get into a populated area?	It's taken on a disguise.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.	When can we expect containment?
When can we expect containment?	Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...	It's in a green Mustang?
Contain it and get back to me.	What do you mean by 'contain?'
It's real, George.	There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
I won't let anyone hurt you.	Watch it. They're coming out.
This is George Fox...	I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.	Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
I love you.	I'm never going to see you again, am I?
What do I do now?	You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.	No, thank you.
How long will it take you to get home?	Many, many days and nights...
This is yours...	If you want to keep it, you can.
If you want to keep it, you can.	I'd like to...
What will you say about us?	I will say that we can be friends.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.	I know how to gamble now.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.	The cook again?
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.	You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
They are beautiful.	Yes, they are.
Oh, you're pretty...	I gave you a baby last night.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?	Do they talk?!
Do they talk?!	No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
You are cold.	You're damn right I am.
You're damn right I am.	I do not get cold.
What are you saying?	You can stop. I will go on alone.
You can stop. I will go on alone.	We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.	I can't stay on this planet.
I can't stay on this planet.	No one's traveling in this weather.
No one's traveling in this weather.	You promised you would get me to my ship.
You promised you would get me to my ship.	I will. I will. We still have another day.
Where are you going?	I must meet my ship.
I must meet my ship.	Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Why can't we wait here for a ride?	I feel better if I move.
I feel better if I move.	We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
Are you angry at me?	No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?	No. Get in.
No. Get in.	You can have one.
I am not a good singer.	That was beautiful.
That was beautiful.	You liked my singing?
You liked my singing?	Yes. Sing some more.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?	I do not want to.
I do not want to.	Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
I like this music.	I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?	Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
What are you doing?	Are you my friend?
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?	I don't understand 'friend.'
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?	It was a mistake.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?	Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.	The car will stop?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'	The driver will...
The driver will...	But I speak English.
But I must go here.	I know that. But the buses don't go there.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.	What is hitchhike?
Do you have a baby?	No... The closest...
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?	Yes. Day... night.
When do you have to be here?	I do not understand.
I do not understand.	How will I do this one?...
Why are you going here? What is here?	My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
It was yellow.	You didn't even see it.
You want to try it?	I want to try it.
I want to try it.	This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
In your pocket, please...	You. Mouth closed.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.	Shit... shit... what shit?
Shit... shit... what shit?	Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?	We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...	He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...	Call the police!!
Call the police!!	Hey buddy... let her go...
You could have killed us both!!	He's kidnapping me!!!
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.	Don't worry. I'll be all right.
They after you?	What? No, of course not.
I told you I'm looking for someone.	In the cars, too?!
In the cars, too?!	I don't know where he is.
You sure this is your car?	My grandmother's rich.
My grandmother's rich.	Slow down, slow down.
Slow down, slow down.	Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.	Save us all a lot of trouble.
Save us all a lot of trouble.	Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
It was a man though... right?	The police think he was high on drugs...
It was only an accident that we discovered them.	I know, but...
Was there visual contact?	No, sir. Radar.
No, sir. Radar.	It could have been anything.
This has always been my favorite time of day.	Very beautiful country up here...
Very beautiful country up here...	Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
I don't understand.	I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
I don't understand.	Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
Where are you going?	Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
I told you...	Judy, that's stupid.
You know that's impossible!	I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Is there a reward in this?	Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't	Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.	Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.	Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.	We can't let you do that.
I made my choice, Lenny.	You're going down.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.	Leave him alone, Tran.
You're too goddamned paranoid.	Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.	Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
You can't just... kill him.	I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.	You think Tran killed her?
We should talk alone.	No.  Mace is in this.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.	You don't know what you're fucking with here.
He has his uses too.	What?  He gonna record you on his label?
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.	I just got to talk to you for one second.
Cut it out, Tran.	Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?	Forget it's there.
Forget it's there.	Make me forget it, baby.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?	Watch and see.
What?  Right Here?	Step into my office.
I understand.  No, I'm not.	You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.	I intend to.
Okay... what about Strickland?	No.  Bad idea.
He's been cooked-off	Is he dead?
You alright?  Y'okay?	Yeah.  No, not really.
Yeah.  No, not really.	Let's work it.
Let's work it.	Not now... I don't want to think about it--
So've I.  Too much.	But this is a bad one.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?	This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.	That's not sayin' much.
Who was just here?	Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.	Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.	What else you got?
I always do.	Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.	See you downtown.
See you downtown.	Yeah.  See you there.
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.	Yeah.  We did.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?	Then we'll be right where we are now.
Then we'll be right where we are now.	Yeah, right.  Fucked.
Take it to him.	A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!	No.  Trust me.
That's the original.  There are no copies.	Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
Alright.  We're going up.	And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
He's totally cut off from the outer world.	How long does it last?  Oh.
Well, look at the plus side.	There's a plus side?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.	Uh unh.  I won't do it.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!	Fire's out, isn't it?
This is bad.	The gas tank's going to go any second!
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.	Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?	Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
You better keep a low profile for a while.	No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
What is it?	This tie doesn't go with blue!
Where we going?	Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
That's where it gets a little strange.	And what about the guy that was following me?
And what about the guy that was following me?	Now you're really getting paranoid.
But that doesn't add, does it.	No it doesn't.
No it doesn't.	Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
No more, Lenny.	Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
Is this great fabric or what?	You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?	Never really thought about it.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.	So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
And gives it to you.	Wants to share.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?	Black.  Jack.
Black.  Jack.	Blackjack?  I don't understand--
So am I.  Just trying to get by.	No, you're just trying to get off.
No, you're just trying to get off.	Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.	You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
Are we having a bad night?	Let's talk in the car.
What the fuck are you doing?	Coming with you.
Coming with you.	You will not live to see the morning.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.	Driving Mr. Lenny.
Sleaze to peddle.	Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--	Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Right.  That explains it.	Are you going to make me beg?
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!	You really want that on your head?
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.	Take the tape to the cops.
Was this him?	Um... he was older.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?	Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?	Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.	Anybody talk to the press?
What's the bad news?	You tell me.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?	Ten miles back on the Texas side.
You run the plates?	Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.	The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
I have 6 tons.	Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.	You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.	It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
I've been looking for you.	Why me? What do you want from me!?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.	You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.	What do you want from me?
Not bad, huh?	You're a... you're sick.
You're a... you're sick.	What's wrong with me?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.	You must travel a lot, huh?
Whole country or just hereabouts?	I don't mean to be rude, but...
He was sitting here?	It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
How did you know he was a construction worker?	He had an orange hat on.
He said it was a clue?	Maybe something to do with Zorro.
You have the photo from the diner?	At the field office.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.	What are you doing?
Maybe cause he's smart.	Smarter than us.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.	I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.	Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?	Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Why did you go to Chicago?	I was visiting an old college friend.
I was visiting an old college friend.	You didn't tell anyone where you were?
I was looking for a pattern.	That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.	I didn't use Low's name.
I didn't use Low's name.	There was talk of a file photo.
There was talk of a file photo.	In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.	We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.	I don't believe this.
I don't believe this.	I'm hesitant to...
I'm hesitant to...	Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?	Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.	Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
I'll take it into consideration.	What I do requires confidentiality.
How do you feel, Agent	Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.	Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.	He got away. I had him. He got away.
He got away. I had him. He got away.	Do you think he singled you out?
Its called insubordination.	Then why do I still have a badge?
Speck. Harold Speck.	From the grave?
Miss me, Dave?	Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
All the same killer?	Low calls him Suspect Zero.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.	Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.	That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
Yeah, of course.	What's going on?
Slow down a second, you met with Low --	You were right. He found me.
You were right. He found me.	And you're working with him?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.	I guess I'm a little paranoid.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.	What's going on?
Jaime? Where are you?	Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
And nobody else can do that?	Not the way I can.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.	I just need to go a little slow.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?	Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
Sue Ann Hanson.	You mean --
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?	We did find these, however.
I've been thinking about this.	Does Koessler ask about me?
Does Koessler ask about me?	He's called a couple times.
He's called a couple times.	What did you tell him?
What did you tell him?	Just routine stuff.
Just routine stuff.	Not about coming to see Daitz?
Not about coming to see Daitz?	Not yet. Not about this, either.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?	Because you asked him to, stupid.
Because you asked him to, stupid.	Oh yeah, I forgot.
He thinks he looks young.	What's this country coming to?
The man knew how to dress.	Don't even go there. What's up?
The other reason?	You want to have dinner?
Yes I do.	It explains a lot.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.	Where's my watch? It's gone.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.	That information's being withheld from the media.
That information's being withheld from the media.	A very sexy case.
Thanks for the ride.	They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?	The Academy, then CIIAC.
How long have you been downtown?	Five months. I love it.
You? You went by the book?	Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
I don't carry it with me.	You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
How did you know Speck was a killer?	The little piggie speaks.
[What does the file say?]	I want to go live with you.
I want to go live with you.	[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
I want to help you.	[Not the heart, the watch.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]	Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Reality very risky.]	Whatever happened to MyDick?
I don't think you understand.	What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.	Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?	This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
Speck is dead.	I talked to him.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.	So you're the new meat?
What did you do to end up here?	I believe it's in my file, sir.
I believe it's in my file, sir.	Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
It's over for you.	Take your shirt off.
You have to put things in perspective.	I know, I know.
I know, I know.	You've been through worse.
You've been through worse.	You're right. I know.
You're right. I know.	Ever since I've known you.
Ever since I've known you.	I don't know about that.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.	Are you calling Her?
Are you calling Her?	No. Stop, come on.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?	You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...	You're a comedian?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.	Are you sure? Maybe...
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.	I'd say about two weeks.
I'd say about two weeks.	Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.	You better pay the man.
How are you ladies doing this evening?	What do you drive?
What kind of car do you drive?	Oh... a Cavalier.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.	To do what?
Just like that?	Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.	How was it hard?
How was it hard?	Well, I left someone very special behind.
Well, I left someone very special behind.	Tell me about it...
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.	Like the quiche?
Like the quiche?	Yes. Like the quiche.
Yes. Like the quiche.	I like quiche.
I like quiche.	I thought real men don't like quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.	My reputation seems to have preceded me.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.	Why? You're not a real man?
They're out of Glenlivet.	What else is going on?
...not until you book it...	...and even then...
...and even then...	...you might get cut out.
Charles! What's up, man?	Oh. You know.
Oh. You know.	Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
"I'm considering taking a job as a ""Goofy""."	Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?	"I haven't heard an official ""no"" yet."
"I haven't heard an official ""no"" yet."	You haven't told then, huh?
Let me just check on my boy.	Don't worry. He's in good hands.
The poor thing. Six years?	...And she's with someone else.
...And she's with someone else.	The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
Oh my God.	Did you get it?
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...	"I'm a ""Dorothy""."
What do you guys do?	I'm a comedian.
A couple of high rollers like you?	Could you believe it?
Could you believe it?	Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
You want this in black chips.	Sure, that'll be fine.
You have to lay it on the table.	Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.	Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...	Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
It's a rebound.	We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.	Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Well, who represents you back east?	Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...	What do you do, Trent?
Are you on the other line?	Yeah, hold on.
Yeah, hold on.	I can call back...
I can call back...	No, no. Hold on.
Can I give you a ride to your car...?	...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...The red piece of shit over there...	...well, it suits you...
...well, it suits you...	...get the hell outta here already...
Well, I should be getting...	...It's really getting late.
...It's really getting late.	...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
You're a comedian?	Yeah. And an actor.
Yeah. And an actor.	I'll have to come see you sometime.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?	...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Well... This is it.	Listen. I had a great time.
I would love to see you again sometime.	I'll be around.
How are you doing?	Fine... I guess. You?
Fine... I guess. You?	Good.  I think about things.
What kind of things?	You know, us.
You know, us.	I thought you met someone else.
I thought you met someone else.	It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
I miss you, Mike.	Why didn't you call?
I think I'm gonna move Back East.	Well, that's dumb.
Well, that's dumb.	What's dumb about it?
What's dumb about it?	Well, you're doing so well...
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...	They turned you down?
I'm such an asshole.	She wasn't your type anyway.
You want to talk about it?	What's the point?
What's the point?	It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
You haven't been drinking, have you?	No. Just O.J.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?	I'll be your winger.
I got to at least try once.	You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
What's that guy's name? Sue?	Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.	Oh, like that song...
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.	Well, let's hit that party.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.	I just tested for one...
I just tested for one...	...yeah, a month ago.
Ah, there's the rub...	There's the rub.
Sounds more like Aids...	...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
How many strokes?	I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.	I'll give you an eight.
I'll give you an eight.	What'd you get?
You want to hit the town tonight?	I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.	What do you have? A Pluto call back?
What do you have? A Pluto call back?	Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?	I didn't want to say anything.
I didn't mention her once today.	Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.	It's a gig.
It's a gig.	I mean, I need the money.
I mean, I need the money.	You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.	It's definitely a step back for me.
Right... or more likely the opposite.	Right... Wait, what do you mean?
There's the rub.	There's the rub.
Hey man, don't sweat it.	...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.	She's really special, guys.
She was cute.	She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.	I can't believe you.
Who threw this party, anyway?	Damned if I know...
What's he do?	He's trying to be an actor.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.	So, what? Eleven?
It's kinda money, actually.	Make someone bleed.
Make someone bleed.	No, man, we're in the play-offs.
You little bitch!	Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
Don't call me ever again.	Wow, I guess you were home...
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.	Hang on, Voltaire.
Are you ready to order?	"Coffee...  Two coffees. It says ""Breakfast Any Time"", right?"
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.	Oh. He's got it under control...
It's not like that...	Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
So, two days?	Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
Please, don't mess with me right now...	We're not messing with you...
We got the digits, baby.	What a surprise.
She didn't see.	That doesn't matter.
You looked right at her, baby.	She didn't notice.
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...	...It looked money.
...the Copa, in New York...	...through the kitchen...
Yeah. You met him once.	"Yeah. He's a ""rounder""."
What time's this party tonight?	It starts at eight...
You guys are such assholes.	Aww... He got away?
This version doesn't have fighting?	No. Doesn't that suck?
No. Doesn't that suck?	What? That was the best part of the old game.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.	Sorry about interrupting...
Christy was nice...	I didn't even like her, to be honest.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.	She was hot.
No, baby. You're money.	She didn't like me, anyway.
She didn't like me, anyway.	She thought you were money.
She thought you were money.	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.	Yeah, a good friend.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.	Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Michelle went for you, right.	That was different.
Selling scrap metal.	See? And what does this guy she's with do?
See? And what does this guy she's with do?	He drives a carriage.
I gotta use the phone.	Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.	Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
No! Not the camera guy!	I'm telling you!
Oh... a Dorothy.	Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
"I'm Mike...  and this is my friend ""Doubledown Trent""."	Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.	Baby, you did fine.
We didn't do so bad after all.	Baby, we're money.
What an asshole.	That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.	That was so demeaning...
That was so demeaning...	She smiled, baby.
She smiled, baby.	I can't believe what an asshole you are.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.	Did she, or did she not smile.
Did she, or did she not smile.	She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.	She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.	What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?	I know she's coming back.
I know she's coming back.	I don't think so.
Mikey's the big winner.	What an asshole.
What an asshole.	Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.	Thanks for clarifying that.
Thanks for clarifying that.	Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.	Yea, how much?
Yea, how much?	I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.	Let's just leave.
Let's just leave.	Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.	I know, but...
I know, but...	You gotta do it.
You gotta do it.	...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
That's where we make our scene.	You think they're watching?
You think they're watching?	Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
Cut that shit out.	She smiled baby.
She smiled baby.	That's not cool.
That's not cool.	Did she, or did she not smile?
Did she, or did she not smile?	It doesn't matter...
It doesn't matter...	I'm telling you, they love that shit.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.	You're gonna screw up our plan.
You're gonna screw up our plan.	We're gonna get laid, baby.
We're gonna get laid, baby.	First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.	What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
They're all skanks.	Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.	You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
I can't lose more than a hundred.	Just bring your card. Half an hour.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.	Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.	Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.	Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.	What are you talking about? Vegas?
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.	I'm not going to Vegas.
The bear's got his claws back.	Be smart about it.
Be smart about it.	I'm telling you. Wait three days...
I'm telling you. Wait three days...	You don't have to wait three days...
It is on.	...it is so on.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...	Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.	Now go over there and get those digits.
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...	...and big fuckin' teeth...
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...	You are so money, and you don't even know it...
That was pretty cold, dude.	What was cold about it?
Yes she did.	Damn. Now I gotta go in early.

They're a finesse team...	They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!	Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
Because he's a bitch.	That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
Bitch... You little bitch!	Chelios to Roenick...!
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.	I'll be back with the coffee.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.	Good.  He never doubted you.
Good.  He never doubted you.	The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Be my friend.	Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
No.  You ask for too much.	I ask for Justice.
I ask for Justice.	The Court gave you justice.
The Court gave you justice.	An eye for an eye!
An eye for an eye!	But your daughter is still alive.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...	Go back to your house and wait for me...
The food is on the table.	I'm not hungry yet.
I'm not hungry yet.	Eat it, it's on the table.
Eat it, it's on the table.	Ba Fa Goulle.
Ba Fa Goulle.	BA FA GOULE YOU!
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.	OK, but be careful.
You think we'll go for that last place?	Maybe, or you gotta know now.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.	Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...	The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...

To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.	To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.	I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.	I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
I'm prepared to take the blame.	What are you talking about?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?	I thought you'd missed the train.
I thought you'd missed the train.	Freddie drove me back in his car.
Freddie drove me back in his car.	Is Freddie here?
I didn't mean with you in it.	Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.

I played piano in a few places.	That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
Could we sail to Venice?	Sure. I love Venice.
Sure. I love Venice.	I have to go to Venice.

You like jazz!	I love jazz.
I'm never going back!	No, I think your mother, her illness --
I met him in New York.	Marge! You've got to hear this!
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.	Okay.  And did we know each other?
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.	What are you doing?
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.	Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.	Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Who is it?	It's Freddie. Let me in.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.	I think it might hurt her to know.
Tom. How are you? You look well.	I'm well, thank you.
I'm well, thank you.	Far cry from New York.
Far cry from New York.	Yes it is.
Yes it is.	Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...	Good. Now you can go for a reason.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.	Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.	Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.	Where's Mr MacCarron?
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.	I'm sure we've met.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?	Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
I don't believe you.	It's all true.
It's all true.	I don't believe a single word you've said.
You've got Dickie's rings.	I can explain.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.	Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
Did Dickie's Dad go?	He's having an early night.
Look at me what?	To the manner born.
Did he kill Freddie?	Marge, when did you get here?
Marge, when did you get here?	Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?	I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Oh my God. Tom.	Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?	Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?	No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
He hates being confronted.	I think you're right.
How long's he staying for?	Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.	How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?	Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.	I was just looking at you --  so quiet.

I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.	Your brother told me.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!	Is she all right?
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.	I don't know, honey.
I don't know, honey.	Why are they trying to kill people?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.	That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?	Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?	What's the matter with them?
It's Alice, ain't it?	No, it's Lois!
Are you sure?	Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.	I need her exact name, you see.
The little girl's name.	The little Brenner girl?
And the white house?	That's where the Brenners live.
That's where the Brenners live.	The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?	Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.	The two kids?
The two kids?	Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.	I see. How do I get down there?
Where does he live?	Right here. Bodega Bay.
Right here. Bodega Bay.	Yes, but where?
Yes, but where?	Right across the bay there.
I wonder if you could help me.	Try my best.
Try my best.	I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.	Birds are not bad!
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.	We'll make our own fog.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.	Well, you're the lawyer.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?	Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
Young woman cut herself.	Shall I call the doctor?
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?	No. Here's fine.
No. Here's fine.	Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
They're gone. The same pattern.	But they'll be back.
But they'll be back.	We won't be here.
We won't be here.	Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
They won't be.	If they are?
If they are?	We'll worry about that when we get there.
I started to say... inside...	You don't have to.
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.	You're doing fine.
You're doing fine.	I mean. I want to...
I can handle it.	I know you can.  But I'd like to.
Mother, get a rope!	Oh, my God, look at her!
Oh, my God, look at her!	Get a rope!
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...	I'm sorry, Mitch.
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?	I got them all, Mother.
I got them all, Mother.	When do you think they'll come?
When do you think they'll come?	I don't know.
That's a chance we have to take.	Maybe we ought to leave.
Maybe we ought to leave.	Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...	Where will we go?
Well... well, is everyone all right?	I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
How long have you known her?	I told you. We met yesterday.
I told you. We met yesterday.	In a bird shop.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?	Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.	Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on?	I'm simply quoting the law.
Seven o'clock, same as usual.	I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
You did say birds?	Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...	Lovebirds, I see.
That's the last of it.	Did you close the door?
Did you close the door?	And locked it.
Would you like me to go for her?	I couldn't ask you to.
I couldn't ask you to.	I don't mind, really.
I don't mind, really.	Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.	I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.	Do I sound foolish to you?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.	Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?	He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.	Then he saw.
Then he saw.	He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.	What good will they do?
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?	No, not exactly.
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...	Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.	Not by the thousands.
What are we going to do about it, Al?	I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?	Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
That's a chimney swift, all right.	We know what it is, Al.
Well, where did he go?	Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.	Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?	Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.	Sixty...  Oh.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.	I'm awfully sorry.
He's not home.	That's all right.
We'd better light some of those lamps.	No... wait.  Hold me.
When will they stop?	I thought they'd have stopped by now.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.	What time is it?
What time is it?	Almost two a.m.
Almost two a.m.	You must be exhausted.
You must be exhausted.	How about you?
Do you want to try your father again?	I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.	Have we still got power?
Have we still got power?	Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
The town looks clear.	The bay doesn't.
The bay doesn't.	How long have they been gathering there?
I think it's safe to get out now.	Don't let's take any chances.
Don't let's take any chances.	We've got to get Cathy.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?	At Annie's house. She's all right.
It's so damn quiet out there.	It was like that yesterday.
It was like that yesterday.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	After the gulls attacked.
Really? Tell me about it.	It's an uprising.
I'll take Cathy up to bed.	Are you staying?
Are you staying?	I think I should, don't you?
Do you want some mustard with this?	No, thank you.
And Fridays? What do you do then?	Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.	I'm glad you do.
I'm glad you do.	Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
What'll it say?	You'll think me very bold, sir.
You'll think me very bold, sir.	No, tell me.
You have a job?	I have several jobs.
I have several jobs.	What do you do?
What do you do?	I do different things on different days.
It is for me.	But not for me.
But not for me.	What do you want ?
Will I be seeing you again?	San Francisco's a long way from here.
How does Mother know what I like to do?	I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.	Oh. That. Rome.
Oh. That. Rome.	Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...	In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.	Without any clothes on?
You were lying.	Yes, I was lying.
I wrote the letter.	What did it say?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.	Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!	I told you what happened in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!	Do you expect me to believe...?
Do you expect me to believe...?	I don't give a damn what you believe!
Why did he shoot her?	He was watching a ball game on television.
Right next to the one you already had.	Look, Mr. Brenner...
What did it say?	None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?	Didn't you see the lovebirds?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.	Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
How do you know Annie?	We... we went to school together. College.
We... we went to school together. College.	Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?	Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
So you're a lawyer.	That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?	Do you practice here?
Do you practice here?	No, San Francisco. What are you...?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?	What kind of law?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?	Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.	Only violators and practical jokers.
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.	What made it...
What made it...	It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
I don't know you.	Ahhh, but I know you.
We met in court.	We never met in court or anyplace else.
We never met in court or anyplace else.	That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.	You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
I think you're a louse.	I am.  Good day.  Madam.
I am.  Good day.  Madam.	And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
What did you say?	I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.	But how... how do you know my name?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?	Well... yes, sir, there are.
No, of course not.	Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?	I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.	Aren't these lovebirds?
Aren't these lovebirds?	No, sir, those are... redbirds.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.	The sign says strawberry finches.
Doesn't what make me...?	All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.	I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.	Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.	Are they moulting now?
Are they moulting now?	Some of them are.
Some of them are.	How can you tell?
How can you tell?	Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
Have you got a pencil?	What? Oh, yes, certainly.
That... that... who was that?	I have no idea.
There we are!	Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?	Hello, Miss Daniels.
Hello, Miss Daniels.	What do you suppose it is?
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?	Maybe! Is it impossible?
What were the crows after at the school?	What do you think they were after, Miss...?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?	Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.	For what purpose?
For what purpose?	To...  To kill them.
Help how? What do you want to do?	I'm not sure, but...
I'm not sure, but...	If you don't even know what you want to do...
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.	No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.	...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
We need them.	Not if they're starting a war.
Not if they're starting a war.	They are incapable of organized warfare!
Scotch, light on the water.	You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?	Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.	Then let's go. Now!
Then let's go. Now!	I haven't finished my drink.
I fear he may have to.	But can't you give me any idea?
I'm Donald Fettes.	I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.	Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
Ask this one favor --	Of course I will.
You asked to see me, ma'am?	I want you to help my little girl.
I want you to help my little girl.	I'm only a student.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.	Did he tell you about Georgina?
He's not home.	Where can I find him?
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.	I'm cold as ice.
You must leave this house.	I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.	Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.	He's a great doctor -- a great man --
This is not a woman!	It was a woman when we put her in.
It was a woman when we put her in.	Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
Where shall we put it? In the back?	No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.	Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Gray killed her.	We can't be sure of that.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.	But you did promise.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.	You see, it is completely out of the question.
You see, it is completely out of the question.	Yes, I suppose so.
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.	You're made for a doctor, young man!
I thought only the best students were made assistants.	Well? And are you not a good student?
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --	Come in, boy -- come in.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.	I wanted to see the white horse --
Aye, but I still wonder how much.	I want it --
Would you bribe me to leave you be?	I would make you rich.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.	I've drunk enough tonight.
I've drunk enough tonight.	Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.	We have never been friends.
I've ordered nothing from you.	This is a gift.
This is a gift.	I take no gifts from you.
I take no gifts from you.	This is a gift you'll not return.
This is a gift you'll not return.	Get out of here!
Get out of here!	Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
The nerve centers -- the brain --	But what makes a thought start?
But what makes a thought start?	In the brain, I tell you. I know.
You know something about the human body, Gray.	I've had some experience.
Toddy hates me.	Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
It might be an interesting case.	That's a good boy, Toddy.
I am the best man for the job.	Why don't you do it then?
I will not have you use that name to me.	You will not have it?
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.	Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.	Don't call me that confounded name.
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?	I come from Lisbon.
What did you hear?	I know --
How long after that was the paralysis complete?	Nearly a year.
Nearly a year.	Any attacks of pain since?
You're not going to Gray.	He must leave me alone.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?	I'll get him.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?	You sent them. I had no choice.
I hate that picture.	Where are they?
Where are they? Last chance.	Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
Where is it? This place?	I think we should get some support?
I think we should get some support?	What? Call the police?
What do they do that they had to kill her?	I was hoping you'd find out.
I was hoping you'd find out.	Yeah. I sure will.
You think I'm crazy.	I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
Two down. Two to go.	"""Down?"" Wait, don't tell me."
Think maybe knives do?	Keep that thing away from me.
That was a fucking hollow point!	I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
What did they give you?	A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
You lied at my trial.	I don't know you, man.
Sssshhh. She's resting.	Where the fuck did you come from?
What Scar? What fucking scar?	AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
How can you die if you're already dead?	You're him. Corvis.
You're him. Corvis.	I was talking about you.
I heard you were looking for this.	You're the guy killed Dutton.
... it connects you to me...	No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
It's ok, it's ok...	It's not. I can't take it.
So you're going to kill him?	Have to find him first.
This tree. Here's where it happened.	I don't want to see!
No. You don't.	Yes I do, I really do.
This is where it happened. Right over here.	Yeah, I know.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.	No! Why are you haunting me?
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.	You killed Lauren! You killed her!
Daisy. How did you know?	I told you, I knew your sister.
I told you, I knew your sister.	You killed that cop Dutton.
You killed that cop Dutton.	And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
Yeah, no kidding.	Your father gave them to both of you.
He didn't kill her.	How do you know?
I was a friend of your sister's.	I know her friends.
I know her friends.	That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
Just don't believe everything you see.	Doubt is a motherfucker.
Doubt is a motherfucker.	Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
They botched the execution.	Could say that.
Could say that.	Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
Guy dressed for Halloween?	Good for you. You do know something.
I do. Every day.	Erin knows, doesn't she?
You mean Alex.	I mean Lauren.
You want me to walk a straight line?	I want you... to bend over.
I want you... to bend over.	Look, can I just call a cab?
Look, can I just call a cab?	What did I say?
What's with your friend there?	She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.	But you, you've had them.
But you, you've had them.	Not tonight. Honest.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.	I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.	Please. Come inside.
Please. Come inside.	I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
You're in with them.	It's not what you think.
It's not what you think.	You killed her!
Stay away from me! Stay away!	Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
I think I dropped an earring.	Looks like you have them both on.
It still doesn't mean...	He said he'd prove it.
What is it?	The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.	Honey. I just can't.
Honey. I just can't.	Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.	Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Why are there so many?	Just hold on to me.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?	He'll be there at 8:30.
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!	That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?	Yes -- of course.
Such power exists?	I assure you such power exists.
I leave that in your hands.	You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?	No -- not at all.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.	That was my first question.
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?	Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
He gave these to you?	Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.	No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?	What do you mean, dear?
Did you have a nice day, dear?	Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?	Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.	I'll say goodnight again.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.	We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.	Mr. Brady's a cop.
Why not, Bobby?	She doesn't like me to steal from people.
Did all these people die in wars?	Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?	No -- I'm afraid not.
No -- I'm afraid not.	"Mr. Carpenter"" -- you don't seem to know about anything."
What does that mean?	It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
You're just kidding, aren't you?	Wouldn't you like to meet him?
You think they'll ever find him?	I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.	Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?	Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.	I thought that was only for bombs.
I thought that was only for bombs.	No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.	You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?	Yes -- I think so.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?	Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.	Where is that?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?	Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Are you an FBI man?	No -- I'm afraid not.
I don't believe it.	Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.	How does he explain that?
I can judge only by what I see.	Your impatience is quite understandable.
The present situation?	I mean the reasons for my coming here.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?	You know about the United Nations?
About five months -- your months.	You must have come a long way.
You must have come a long way.	About 250 million of your miles.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.	What about him?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.	How do you know?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?	You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Is that what you're thinking about?	Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--	Come on in.
I wonder if we ought to--	Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.	You think it's all right for you to stay here?
Is it real?	Looks real to me.
I will be in just a minute.	The picture starts at eight-fifty.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.	I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.	I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
It was a wonderful day.	You still haven't answered my question.
He'll have you -- and Tom.	No. That's all finished.
"""Klaatu barada nikto."""	Remember those words.
Where is the meeting going to be?	At the ship.
It must be twelve-thirty.	Yes -- Just exactly.
Oh -- hello--	May I see you for a minute?
May I see you for a minute?	I -- I was Just going to lunch.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.	May I walk out with you?
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.	Goodnight, my dear.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.	Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.	He has his homework to keep him occupied.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.	He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.	Naturally I think so.
Everyone seems so--	Jittery is the word.
I don't know how to thank you.	I enjoyed every minute of it.
You sure about that?	Would you like to sell it?
Would you like to sell it?	No -- no, thanks.
No -- no, thanks.	I'd give you a very good price.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?	Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
No -- I'm afraid not.	Well, how do I know who you are?
But I suppose you know the answer.	It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
Well... we blew Plan A.	Time to activate Plan B.
Time to activate Plan B.	What's Plan B?
They're gaining on us!	You gotta drive!
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!	We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!	We don't ride with vampires.
We don't ride with vampires.	Fine!  Stay here!
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.	Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
He's my brother.	You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.
Can't stand light?	Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.	You better get some fresh air.
How do you like Santa Carla?	It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
I don't like horror comics.	This one could save your life.
Did you see that sucker burn?!	Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!	Two down and two to go.
Two down and two to go.	<u>Four</u> to go.
They're looking at us.	They're gonna book us.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?	The Prince of Darkness.
The Prince of Darkness.	The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
What is this, David?	You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
Where is she?!	Hey, take it easy.
Hey, take it easy.	Where's Star, David?!
What's going' on?	What's goin' on, Marko?
I'm my own man.	Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
Don't!  Stop!	Why?  They're only noodles.
We were gonna grab some food.	Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
We still going?	Honda 250, huh?
You can't kill me, Star.	I will, David!
I will, David!	No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.	No.  Stick around.
Where you going?	For a ride.
What happens in tow and a half hours?	The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
No, Nanook!  Quiet!	Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
What's that smell!?	Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
He's not glowing.	Hit the lights again.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?	His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
Or a vampire.	Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???	Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
Don't go out there!  Stop him!	Sam, don't --
Smells good.  When do we eat?	I told Max eight o'clock.
I told Max eight o'clock.	Max?  You men we're having company again?
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!	It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Did we have a date tonight?	I guess so.  She said not to be late.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.	I better get cleaned up, then.
Are we havin' fun or what?	I thought we were goin' into town.
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!	Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
... And stay outta here.	You have a T.V.?
You like Michael.	I like Michael.
I like Michael.	You better not like him too much.
You didn't tell David?	No.  Just you.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.	It was a dream, Star.
It was a dream, Star.	No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
Hi... I'm Laddie.	This is Michael.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.	I'm tired now.
I'm tired now.	Wait a minute, kiddo.
Michael, are you still in bed?	No.  I'm up.
He looks dead.	He's just a deep sleeper.
He's just a deep sleeper.	He's not breathing, Mom.
Oh, no.  Now what?	Must be a circuit breaker.
What's wrong?  Tell me.	We can't talk about it on the phone.
Lights out, Sam.	Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
He met a girl.	I guess no one cares what I got a job.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.	Can we get a T.V.?
Tell them to get something to eat.	I thought we were poor.
I thought we were poor.	Not that poor.
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!	That's the boardwalk, Sam.
We're getting close...	What's that smell?
Max!  What's wrong?	It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
This looks terrific, Lucy.	Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
Not impressed, are you?	Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
-- a job.	Do I look that needy?
Does it burn?	Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?	Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
It's gone.  I feel it!	So do I!
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?	They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
David's looking for me... I have to go.	You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Because I love you...	Then it's not too late for us...
I know, I've felt it...	I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.	Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Let's go see them.	No... no, everything's different now...
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?	What do you mean?
Well... yeah.  Sure.	Okay.  Talk.
Okay.  Talk.	I just wanted to... I, uh...
What's the matter?	I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.	Wanna go to the comic book store?
Did you spill something?	No.  Why?
No.  Why?	The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?	What would that make Mom?
What would that make Mom?	You're right... not even to mention you and me.
This room is mine.	I was here first.
I was here first.	Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.	Even poor people have T.V.s
Where these tracks headed?	Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.	Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
What the hell you looking at me like that for?	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Look, I know it's hard to believe...	So what's our problem?
How you doin', old boy?	I don't know who to trust.
Let's open it.  Now...	Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.	If it did get to him.
We got to burn 'em.	Now hold on, you dumb...
Somebody broke in.	Now who'd go and do...
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.	Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?	Ain't it there?
I said where?  Where'd you go?!	Was dark... find a light...
Was dark... find a light...	You lying bastard...
You catch anything he was saying?	Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.	Cut him loose?
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!	Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!	I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
It's shorted out or something!	Clark, you come on out here!!
Maybe we shouldn't.	Then we'll never make it.
I think so.	"What do you mean ""you think so?"""
Spaceship of some kind.	Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Load of bullshit.	We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
We should have jumped his ass.	Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
You ain't tying me up.	Then I'll have to kill you.
Then I'll have to kill you.	Then kill me.
What do we do about those three?	We got morphine, don't we.
What we going to do?!	How the fuck do I know?!
Where's the other half?	Probably the next meal.
Look, I'm just guessing...	Well, go on.
And if anyone tries to wake me...	Damn you, MacReady!
Now hold him.	I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Would that test have worked?	I think so.
Well, who's got access to it?	I guess I'm the only one.
My God, what in hell happened here?	Come on, Copper.
How long will it take you to prepare this?	A couple of hours.
A couple of hours.	Well, get to it.
Nothing we can do about that.	Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.	In this weather?
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.	After all this mess then.
After all this mess then.	After all this mess.
When was the last time you used it?	A day or so ago... I guess.
How many in their party?	Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.	How far's that?
How far's that?	'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
How long's it been?	Little over two hours.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?	I am going after them.
We're on fire!	Don't let up, Childs!
What kind of test?	I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...	I ain't going with Sanchez.
Somebody definitely messed with it.	We going to make it?
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...	Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.	And that was enough?
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.	Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Where were the flashlights?	Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
Maybe it ain't coming.	Then we go after him.
Then we go after him.	Bet the last place you ever go.
Calm down and get in your position.	Position, my ass...
What about Childs?	Forget about Childs.  He's over.
Where was he trying to go?	Anyplace but here.
What is it?	Everything that's been missing.
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.	What are you going to do?  Drink it?
It's the generator I think!  No power.	Well, let's get down there.
We should sleep in shifts.	Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.	Who else could have used that key?
So what do you make of it?	You know damn well what we both make of it.
He's one of them.	When do you think it got to him?
Yes.  Just about here.	But there's nothing here.
... Well, you wanted to see it.	This is it?
What kind of stories?	About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
What else can they do?	Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
And everyone looks like us?	Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.	'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
What do you do on the towers?	On the towers?
On the towers?	I'm training to be a high climber.
Now how did you get hurt?	I had an accident.
I had an accident.	I figured that.  What kind of accident?
It must have been hard, leaving your work.	The journey is part of my work.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.	I'll never forget this.
I don't understand.	I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
What do you mean?	Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
What's it all for?	The air... the power.
The air... the power.	Why did they built it?
Why did they built it?	The Morlocks didn't build this.
It's what they want you to see.	This is the way in?
This is the way in?	Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?	Oh, shut up.
My God... I saw this.	It frightens you.
You know of them?	Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?	Do you know where they live?
But you escaped.	I was lucky.  The others weren't.
I was lucky.  The others weren't.	How have you survived so long?
Sir... have you a name?	I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
What are you?	I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
I don't think that's going to happen.	And why not?
I'm tired of running.	Oh, you won't be running for long...
That was a foolish thing to do.	I'm a foolish man.
And what of the Eloi?	They survived above.  Became what they are.
How do you control the Morlocks?	We make them see what we wish.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.	Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.	You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?	There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
May I help you?	I -- what are you?!
Heavens, look at that now!	I've seen it.
Alex, what is it?	Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Let's walk through the park...	No... let's walk through the city.
Alex, what is it?	Holding you... again.
Got here as soon as I could.	Dance with me...
Dance with me...	You know I can't.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.	Hold on... I know I have it...
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.	All right, what is it now?
All right, what is it now?	Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.	Admiration?  My my.
Admiration?  My my.	I mean... well... affection.
I mean... well... affection.	You're getting warmer.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?	Sorry... I was distracted.
Sorry... I was distracted.	Well there's something new.
Well there's something new.	I need to... um... talk to you.
I need to... um... talk to you.	Talk away, Professor.
Talk away, Professor.	Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
Got here as soon as I could.	Dance with me...
Dance with me...	You know I can't.
Good night, David.	Good night, Alex.
What is it?	You wouldn't believe me.
Why don't you come to our house instead?	I can't do that --
That's absurd --	You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --	That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
I live with it every minute of every day.	I know that --
I'm sorry, David.	It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.	Then why are you here?
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.	Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?	No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
Do you know you were humming?	I was not.
I was not.	"Somewhere around ""D+2xy something something."""
"Somewhere around ""D+2xy something something."""	Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.	Tonight's the night?
Tonight's the night?	God, and I'm running late --
Did you hear me, lad?	All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Mara -- what -- ?!	Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
So you can use it now?	Yes... I suppose so.
Yes... I suppose so.	Go back to your own time?
This is where my journey started... right here.	You lost someone.
It must have been safe.	Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.	It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
The mud carriers.	I can see Kalen's point.
I can see Kalen's point.	Want to be a high climber now, do you?
What's it all for?	I don't understand.
We all have that dream.	All of you?
You share dreams?  That's incredible.	We share everything.
You seem fascinated by the stars.	You can see so many here.
You can see so many here.	Don't then have stars where you come from?
Oh, that explains everything.	I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.	That machine --
That machine --	Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.	How long ago?
How long ago?	More than 800,000 years.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.	Then you can speak slowly.
You're not from beyond the valley.	What makes you say that?
Your husband is dead?	He's gone to a better place.
Is there a lot of illness?	Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.	May I get you some --
May I get you some --	That'll be all.
Yes, sir, he --	Tell him to go away --
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?	Oh, I'm already swooning.
Oh, I'm already swooning.	Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.	Do you have it?!
Do you have it?!	Hello, Mr. Philby.
"Well... perhaps I have ""deviated"" the tiniest bit."	Might I ask why?
Might I ask why?	Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Then it's time to change that --	We are what we are.
Where do they take them?!	We don't know.
We don't know.	We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!	They've gone to a better place.
They've gone to a better place.	You know that's not true.
You know that's not true.	We choose to believe it.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?	I suppose so.
I am the oldest.	No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?	My father has gone to a better place.
My father has gone to a better place.	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
He said he traveled for two months.	I took a different route.
What are your people called?	Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --	They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !	No, you're safe --
No, you're safe --	They're inside --
We'll see about that.	I am.  Are you a climber?
What did you do at night?	What's it like where you come from?
We never should have done this to him...	Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
But... what about Starks?	What about Starks?
What about Starks?	Should we be...
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.	I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
Who are you?	I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.	[Beat] You're his son?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?	You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!	Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
That wasn't a fucking restraint.	Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
He's recovering on the third floor.	Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!	Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?	[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?	It's not my job to believe you.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.	[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?	I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?	Depends on what you're seeing.
That's too bad.	I thought you said you never knew your father.
My father used to talk about you.	Oh yeah, what'd he say?
Did you know my father?	Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
Do I know you from somewhere?	You may have known my father, William Starks.
What should they be looking for?	They should just be looking harder.
I need to get this letter to someone.	I can't take you out of here in your condition...
This is really happening, isn't it?	[Beat] What do you need me to do?
[Beat] What do you need me to do?	[Beat] Thank you.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!	Mom, he just fixed our car.
Mom, he just fixed our car.	Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
How you doin'?	I'm doing fine.
I think so.	You're bleeding pretty bad there.
I've been ok.	Good. How's your mom?
Good. How's your mom?	Ok, I guess.
You gotta stop thinking like that.	Then, where are you going?
Then, where are you going?	Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
Where are we going?	To the hospital.
They've got lives to be grateful for.	William, you're not making sense.
Then why isn't there anyone around?	[Beat] I don't know.
What? What are you thinking?	There're no cars on this street.
How long do we have?	I don't know.
I have no idea.	You think Lorenson kills you?
It's December 25th, 1993 today.	No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
I think I can remember what's on them.	William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
But I like it I guess.	Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Your mom take anything before this happened?	Yeah, but I don't know what.
Yeah, but I don't know what.	[Beat] What's your name?
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...	You two ok?
You two ok?	Our car won't start.
I don't understand.	I still don't either, even after all these years.
What are you talking about?	You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
I'm not gonna let that happen.	You still don't believe me, do you?
You still don't believe me, do you?	I do believe you...
I do believe you...	No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
Who...who kills me?	You have nothing to fear, William.
How...how do you know?	You told me this was how it happened.
Why don't you help me?	Because I don't have time.
And how do you know that?	Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.	William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
It doesn't look all that different.	The future doesn't look different?
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?	Come on. Tell me what you do know.
What do you mean?	You have no idea what's going on.
You have no idea what's going on.	No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.	I'll die either way.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.	[Beat] We will.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?	How do you know about Dr. Becker?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?	My dad wrote some things down before he died.
How'd he get it?	[Beat] I don't know.
My God you look exactly like him.	I never knew my father. Did you?
I never knew my father. Did you?	Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
Why, what would you do?	I could try to...make it stop.
I could try to...make it stop.	No. I don't want it to.
No. I don't want it to.	So it's helping?
And if I didn't want to come?	I guess I'd ask you why.
I guess I'd ask you why.	Because I don't think I'm crazy.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.	You're not crazy.
"Geez, how's that for a fucking ""thank you""?"	Is it true?
What were you talking about the other day?	I wasn't talking about anything.
I tried to kill my wife.	Don't you go to jail for that?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?	Where are you going?
This is a great song.	You remember it?
You don't think that's crazy?	Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
Yup. That's me.	You like it?
You like it?	[Beat] I do it.
[Beat] I do it.	Have you always been a waitress?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?	No. [Beat] Not around here.
Well, how'd you get here?	[Beat] I was dropped off.
[Beat] I was dropped off.	Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Well, where are you from?	I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.	Of course you don't know.
Of course you don't know.	"Why ""of course""?"
I'm not sure.	You don't have anywhere to stay?
You don't have anywhere to stay?	I don't think so.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.	I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?	I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
In the leg.	I gotta go to Little Rock.
Who's the nut?	That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
We're both fine.	Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?	Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
I've been better.	You girls are in some hot water.
You girls are in some hot water.	Yes, sir.  I know.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?	That's certainly possible.
I have no problem with that.	Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.	Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
What did ya do?	I'm a robber.
I'm a robber.	You're a bank robber?
You're a bank robber?	Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Oh.  I... where's Louise?	She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
Well, I guess I'd better...	Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?	I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?	I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.	That sounds nice.
That sounds nice.	Well, you wanna use the shower?
Louise, is that you?	Thelma?  It's me.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?	Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.	I always knew that.
I always knew that.	A regular outlaw.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.	Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.	Who's your friend?
Will you at least see how it fits?	Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Jimmy... it's beautiful!	You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
Tell me now.	Call me back.
Do you love me?	Christ, sure... yes!
Christ, sure... yes!	Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
I am funny.  I'm real funny.	Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Am I in trouble?	As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?	You wanna let me see your license, please?
You're a good friend.	You, too, sweetie, the best.
We're not giving up, Thelma.	Then let's not get caught.
Then let's not get caught.	What are you talkin' about?
God!  It looks like the Army!	All this for us?
What in the hell is it?!	It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
You're a good friend.	You too, sweetie, the best.
You too, sweetie, the best.	I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
How far are we from Mexico?	About two hundred and fifty miles.
About two hundred and fifty miles.	How long do you think that'll take?
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?	Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.	We can change our names.
We can change our names.	We can live in a hacienda.
It'd have to be pretty good.	It would have to be pretty damn good.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.	Me too.  I feel awake.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?	What do you mean?
You know why.  You already said.	What'd I say again?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.	Are you alright?
Nothing.  It's not funny.	What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.	We should have just ignored him.
This is so beautiful.	Gosh.  It sure is.
What little dogs?	You know those little dogs you see people with?
You know those little dogs you see people with?	Like a Chihuahua?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.	Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
Now what what?	Whaddo we do?
Louise?  Where are we?	Just past Boise City.
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.	I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.	Let's get it over with.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?	Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
You think you've found your calling?	Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.	Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Taking a shower.	You left that guy alone in the room?
What's wrong with you?	Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
What happened to your hair?	Nothing.  It got messed up.
He's got a lot to be proud of.	Louise and Darryl don't get along.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.	That's puttin' it mildly.
That's puttin' it mildly.	She thinks he's a pig.
I wish we could've brought him with us.	What did Darryl say?
Will I be?	I don't know.  I won't be.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.	Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Did you finish thinking?	I think better when I drive.
Give me the keys.	You're not touchin' that car.
What do you mean?	Why are you actin' like this?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.	Just what the hell is wrong with you?
I'm cash poor.	Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Just what is that supposed to mean?	It means shut up, Thelma.
It means shut up, Thelma.	So this is all my fault, is it.

How'd you know that?	It's right there on your golf bag.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.	Same here again.
Same here again.	By the way, what's your name?
You own a home there?	Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.

All you want is a phone number?	Well, I know you're busy...
Well, I know you're busy...	Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't buy it.	You don't buy what?
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.	Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
How'd you manage that one?	Friend. Baseball bat.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.	What do you mean?
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.	Maybe this'll jog your memory.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?	Did you build the Estadio Olympico?

Pat's an architect, too.	Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.	But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
What what are you doing here?	You forgot your keys!
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.	Then what the fuck did you do it for?
So you're a writer?	Trying to be.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.	That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.

What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.	I'll be evacuated with the President.
How's my favorite President?	Busy. But you've got his heart.
Busy. But you've got his heart.	I want an hour with him.
I want an hour with him.	I said his heart, not his attention.
I said his heart, not his attention.	Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.	What about you? Where are you going?
What about you? Where are you going?	Back to work.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.	Damn right I'm scared.

The Last Resort.	You're getting off to an early start.
What to the rebels want?	Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Welcome to Mars.	What was that?  An accident?
Over there man.	You got the job.
What's wrong with this one?	He ain't got five kids to feed.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.	Hey, I got four kids to feed.
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.	But maybe you can change all that.
But maybe you can change all that.	I think my grampa might be here.
Need a ride?	The Last Resort!  Quick!
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.	Who are you?
How'd you find me?	I'd advise you to hurry.
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.	Get it, please.
So why am I still alive?	We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.	Don't be an idiot.
Stop fighting and get out.	They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
He had help.  From our side, sir.	I know that.
I know that.	But I thought...
What the fuck is going on down there?!	I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
I'm with an very important client.	Looks like another schizoid embolism.
What is it?	You better get down here.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.	Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.	Nice to meet you.
You open it.	No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Pull them out.	O.K., everybody pull out!
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.	This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.	Any news of Quaid?
Any news of Quaid?	Not since you lost him.
Not since you lost him.	Watch your mouth, Captain.
On his way.	You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
You tell me.	I don't know.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.	Relax, you'll live longer.
Harry, what the hell is this?	Come on, let's go have that drink.
Come on, let's go have that drink.	What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!	You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!	Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
What are you, my father?	Let me buy you a drink.
Let me buy you a drink.	No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
Look at this shit.	What the hell is this?
I've got a weak signal over there.	Split up.  Find him.
Where is he?	Level 2.  Galleria.
Level 2.  Galleria.	He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.	I've got Quaid.
Are you saying she liked it?	I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
The fare is eighteen credits, please.	Quit while you're ahead.
Quit while you're ahead.	Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Would you please repeat the destination?	Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?	Drive!  DRIVE!!
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.	How did I get in this taxi?!
How did I get in this taxi?!	The door opened.  You got it.
I love you.	Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
I suppose you're not here either.	I'm here at Rekall.
I didn't know you were so kinky.	It's time you found out.
Not talk!  I said TALK!!	I'm not your wife.
I'm not your wife.	The hell you're not.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?	It was implanted by the Agency.
It was implanted by the Agency.	And falling in love?
You went to those brain butchers?!	Let me finish!
Let me finish!	What did they do to you?  Tell me!
What did they do to you?  Tell me!	--I got a trip to Mars.
--I got a trip to Mars.	Oh God, Doug.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.	They did!  But I killed them!
What are you doing?	Some men just tried to kill me!
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.	Just think about it.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.	And you believe him?
And you believe him?	All right, forget about it.
...You mean it?	You know I do.
Let me go!	Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Nobody?!  What's her name?	I don't know.
The brunette.  The one you told me about.	Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!	What's he talking about?
What's he talking about?	Let me go!
How real does it seem?	As real as any memory in your head.
As real as any memory in your head.	Come on, don't bullshit me.
Right.  Mars.	That a problem?
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.	Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
Nice to meet you.	Good to see ya. Right this way.
You sure about this?	It's just up ahead.
"Where's this ""reactor"" come from?"	Aliens built it.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?	I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
I don't need Kuato for that.	Oh, since when?
Not bad, for a hooker.	I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?	I used to model for 'em, why?
So you dropped by to apologize?	Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
I thought you didn't like me.	If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
I said get out!	Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
I think you better leave.	Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.	I'm not falling for it.
Why would I lie to you?	Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.	Don't be ridiculous.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?	Hauser left me a note.
Hauser left me a note.	Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.	Not any more.
I don't remember you.	What are you talking about?
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!	I guess he didn't.
I love you.	I love you.
This is the suitcase you gave me.	I gave you?
How much you think?	I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
You can't fight'em that way...	You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?

Knock it off, Burt!	I think I scared it!
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...	Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.

She's got my vote.	Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.	In a minute.
You're really leaving, huh?	You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
We're not going over there, right?	No.  We go straight.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!	VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
Oh my God.	Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?	I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!	Not yet, not yet...

They're...they're trying to make us move!	Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!	It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.

Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...	Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.

Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?	Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
I'm gonna kick his ass!	I'm gonna help you.
Don't he have a home to go to?	Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Well, folks, what's the plan?	First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.	Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Prairie dog burrow...	Little sons of bitches.
We'll take your word for it.	Yeah.  Where's your truck?
What the hell are they?	Sons of bitches!
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.	Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?

Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!	You're hung up again.

They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.	Christ... Shu is innocent.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!	What's Art Esparza?
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?	I followed her from the courthouse.

I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.	It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
You ready for this?	We'll find out in a hurry.
You think he saw us?	Who knows, baby?
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?	It's just another case, Sailor.
It's just another case, Sailor.	What's that, peanut?
Come look at this.	What's that, honey?
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.	What kinda trash talk is that?
...are followin' him around.	Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?	Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.	That don't seem fair.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.	You ain't takin' Pace, though.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.	Course I am, mama.
Course I am, mama.	What time's Sailor's train get in?
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.	Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.	Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.	Really, mama, I gotta go.
Really, mama, I gotta go.	What if I asked you not to?
What if I asked you not to?	Wouldn't make any difference.
Wouldn't make any difference.	What if I told you not to?
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.	Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Just a place.	Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?	Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
You got nice tits.	Someone's gonna see us.
Someone's gonna see us.	That's just another part of the price to pay.
"I'm gonna take your silence as a ""yes""..."	Santos... I can't...
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.	Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Santos... No... Please, Santos...	You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
I knew you'd want it again...	That's not why I called.
That's not why I called.	Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.	Santos... It isn't.
Santos... It isn't.	Have it your way... But you want it.
Have it your way... But you want it.	Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.	What do you want me to do about it?
I want you to get rid of Sailor.	Get rid of him?
Get rid of him?	Yes... Get rid of him.
Simple? Kill him? How?	That's your business... I don't care how.
That's your business... I don't care how.	Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?	NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!	Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.	No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
See! I knew you had it all under control.	Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?	Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...	Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.	Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.	You heard right.
You heard right.	You really are one dumb asshole.
You really are one dumb asshole.	Life is unpredictable.
It's the Chancellor.	Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
So I hear.	No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.	He's right, you look horrible.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?	We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
Do you know he won't expel him?	No. But I don't think that matters.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.	Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
Kind of a sign, you're saying.	In a sense.
Naturally you have copies.	I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
That was MacCaulay.	Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.	He was never able to reproduce them.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?	Call it a hunch.
So whose car is it?	My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.	The hood jumper?
Want some help with that?	Don't touch it.
So -- what do we do now?	Find the jacket.
Find the jacket.	Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Who do you think it is?	The Chancellor's here? Now?
The Chancellor's here? Now?	Evidently.  Coming!
Shut up, James.	So what's the problem?
Is he awake?	I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.	What's to tell?
What's to tell?	Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
James? My James? What's happened?	Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.	Kidnapped? By who?
It's a little late to call Admissions.	Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?	Maybe... I don't know.
You stay there.	What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --	Tripp, where the hell...
Wait here. I'll be right back.	Where would we go?
What's this guy's problem?	Just go around him.
That was good.	He heard everything we were saying.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.	Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.	He can't piss standing up anymore.
He can't piss standing up anymore.	He lives with his mother.
He lives with his mother.	And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?	Shut up and drink.
So. Is he any good?	No. Not yet he isn't.
No. Not yet he isn't.	Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
He has a book.	I know. He started it Fall semester.
I know. He started it Fall semester.	He finished it Winter Break.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.	Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.	Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
She left me. Crabs.	Left you...? Who? Emily?
Left you...? Who? Emily?	This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
He said something about being between things.	Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??	It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.	I thought you were tinkering.
I thought you were tinkering.	I just mean...
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.	Perfect. Well then, shall we?
How are you, Crabtree?	Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.	You must be mistaken.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.	Better luck next time.
Better luck next time.	So is my friend... is Sara still here?
So is my friend... is Sara still here?	No. There's no one here.
No. There's no one here.	I have to see her. As soon as possible.
She told you about...	Her dog, yes.
Her dog, yes.	Actually, it was her husband's dog...
How long have you been having them?	The last month maybe.
The last month maybe.	How long have you been smoking marijuana?
How long have you been smoking marijuana?	Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
I've been trying to finish a book...	And your wife left you.
And your wife left you.	Is that in my chart?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.	No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Who the hell is that?	A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.	Who's got a gun?
Who's got a gun?	You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
...reconcile with Emily.	Are you there to not reconcile with her?
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.	Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
You're in Kinship?	Yes. But that's not why I called...
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...	Just what? Doing a little dusting?
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.	I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?	I'm a little worried, James.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.	Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
I'm not going, with them.	James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Where you going?	Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
What would you call them then?	I don't know... 'Episodes.'
Jealous? Of me?	Not you. Your talent.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...	How can you tell?
How can you tell?	You can see the outline of a butt.
The one that left you?	That's right. That one.
Kinship. And what's here?	Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
What kind of dancer?	Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?	When we fall, we fall hard.
She seemed to take it pretty well.	Yeah, well, actually...
I guess there's probably a story behind that.	There is, but it's not that interesting.
There is, but it's not that interesting.	So where have you been staying?
So where have you been staying?	The bus station.
That's a big book you're writing.	I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.	Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
The guy on the phone.	What'd he say?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.	There is, but it's not that interesting.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.	I put you on the floor.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...	What's he saying?
Can I ask you something about her?	She is. Ah. Here we go...
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.	I had to. Didn't I?
I had to. Didn't I?	Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
They're glass. The buttons.	Like the lady herself.
Is that really it?	That's really it.
That's really it.	The one she wore on her wedding day?
The one she wore on her wedding day?	So I'm told.
I'll miss my bus.	This is worth it.
So what are you doing out here?	It's colder in there.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.	So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.	Sounds like a good one.
Sounds like a good one.	It's not bad.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?	No! What gave you that idea?
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...	...You carry firearms.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.	That good, huh?
That good, huh?	No, it's not that, it's...
He cribbed that from Borges.	It beats 'What's your major?'
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?	I told you, Sewickly Heights.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.	But where? I need the street.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.	Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.	Oh. Well. I...
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.	That strikes me as odd.
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.	James'll know about George Sanders.
Thanks for that. He all right?	I think so... What about you?
I think so... What about you?	Me? Sure. Why?
You don't deserve me, you know.	I know, but sometimes...
Did you tell Walter?	I told Walter.
I told Walter.	Does he still love you?
Does he still love you?	It didn't come up.
Ouch. How many?	Dozens. It's very sad.
I lost it all.	Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
He told you.	He told me.
He told me.	And what did you say?
And what did you say?	I said it didn't sound like you.
I think I might have.	And what do you think you might have said?
And the jacket?	Over there. In the backseat of the...
What's he doing out there?	I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
About the baby.	That... and you.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.	Really? That was fast.
Really? That was fast.	I'm kidding. Hello?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?	Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...	Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
You heard? How?	A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.	Did you confess?
You got me.	I love you, Grady.
Who's gun is that?	It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.	No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Is the thing -- is it over?	Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?	Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Emily left me this morning.	She's left before...
She's left before...	She's left the room before. She always came back.
You go first.	All right. This morning --
I got the message you called.	I got the message you called too.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.	It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?	Jesus. Is that what he told you?
Listen, Antonia --	Tony. Now that I'm home.
I'm not sure that's possible.	Sure it is.
I need a ride.	I'm your man.
Who's he barking at now?	He's still barking at me. He's blind.
That's a nice greenhouse.	It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
Who's this ?	It's Grady, Walter.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?	It's three-thirty, Grady.
It's three-thirty, Grady.	This is important.
What is it, Grady?	I'm in love with your wife.
Holy shit. Are you serious?	As a heart attack.
As a heart attack.	Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
Do you get high, Sam?	Only when I'm working.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?	Taking the long way home.
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?	Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Is it good?	I don't know. It might be...
Where you stand?	I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.	She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.	Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?	Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
What made you pull out that old thing?	I was thinking of you.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.	Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
I might have his number on campus.	That's all right. We'll find him.
A jockey? You mean, like --	Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
There's so many...	Just a few then. The big ones.
Are you riding with me, James?	No, I'm going ho --
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.	I doubt it, darling.
You want to keep him happy.	If he's happy...  I'm happy.
What do you mean?	I mean... feelings.
Ask me. Ask me anything.	Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
You don't have to tell me this.	I'm just talking, man.
I'm just talking, man.	Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.	I know. I'm just saying I understand.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.	It's not what you think.
Ah, come on.	I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
It wasn't like that.	Then what? What?!
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.	It's a nice table.
What are you doing?	This little table is one heavy bitch.
How is she?	Annette? She's good... tense.
Annette? She's good... tense.	When can I see her?
When can I see her?	I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.	Is it because of Anna?
Is it because of Anna?	I don't know. She won't talk about it.
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.	Something wrong with that?
Something wrong with that?	I was just thinking of... the noise.
I was just thinking of... the noise.	I like the noise.
Hey, is that a school?	K through sixth.
I'll never forget you got me started there.	I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.	Yeah, you still with Northland?
Don't you have friends?	I have friends.
I'm not pretty.	Well... not in the common way.
What are you writing in that book?	It's my bird book.
Something like that.	That was terrific.
That was terrific.	You should hear the bird.
You should hear the bird.	You live around here?
You live around here?	Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?	Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.	Were you watching me?
I have to go.	Do you come here often?
Do you come here often?	My daddy likes me home before dark.
My daddy likes me home before dark.	It's good to listen to your daddy.
I'd love to hear it.	It's a bright sound.
You always carry these?	When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.	It's just a city park.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.	Their sound is quite musical.
Their sound is quite musical.	How does it sound?
How does it sound?	It's hard to describe.
Is that right?	I don't like starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.	The mother sure has her hands full.
There's a million birds here.	In that birch tree is a nest.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.	I count my blessings.
I count my blessings.	Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.	I have a passionate girlfriend.
I have a passionate girlfriend.	What's with the boxes?
What's with the boxes?	You're a cop. Figure it out.
You're a cop. Figure it out.	I'd say you're moving.
I'd say you're moving.	It's a free country, isn't it?
I wasn't feeling well.	I could take you downtown.
I could take you downtown.	You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
I was asleep.	I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.	You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.	The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.	I went to bed around seven.
The one with the ax?	I don't know.
It's not for sale.	Who said I wanted to buy it?
I haven't broken any laws.	Then you won't mind if I look around.
I could get a search warrant.	If you could, you would have brought one today.
You don't know?	I have no idea.
I have no idea.	I think you do.
I think you do.	Why don't you just tell me?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?	You are in.
So. How are you adjusting?	I'm adjusting okay.
I'm adjusting okay.	And your new apartment?
Are you taking your medication?	It gives me headaches.
It gives me headaches.	But you are taking it?
People have the right to know.	If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
I don't mind.	You should go home.
You should go home.	Can't I stay a little longer?
Can't I stay a little longer?	It's getting dark. Go home.
It's getting dark. Go home.	Will I see you again?
But will he... ?	Your daddy will always love you.
Your daddy will always love you.	How do you know?
How do you know?	I know because... it's just something I know.
I know because... it's just something I know.	I don't want to hurt my daddy.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.	Robin, listen to me.
Would you like to sit on my lap?	No thank you.
No thank you.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.	That's okay... doesn't matter.
That's okay... doesn't matter.	Do you want me to sit on your lap?
Yeah, like the bird.	Can I ask how old you are?
How do you feel about that?	I feel... okay.
It was a small house.	All right. A small house... with small rooms.
Did you get an erection?	I was six years old!
I was six years old!	I meant later... when you two took naps.
This is garbage!	I'm only asking questions.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.	You felt pleasure.
I don't like nobody behind my back!	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
What the hell are you doing there?	Did you and your sister often take naps together?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?	I want you back in your chair! Right now!
And what are you doing?	Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --	Not so fast.
Not so fast.	Sorry.  Where is she?
Sorry.  Where is she?	In my bedroom, sleeping.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?	Where are you?
Where are you?	In my bed too.
In my bed too.	How old are you and your sister?
How old are you and your sister?	We're little kids.
We're little kids.	But roughly, how old?
But roughly, how old?	I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Who do you see?	I see my sister.
I don't see --	In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.	Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
When did it all start?	You mean my problem?
I don't know.	That's not a helpful answer.
That's not a helpful answer.	That's my answer.
Please don't do it again.	I said I was sorry.
I said I was sorry.	I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person.
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.	I want to talk about it now.
I want to talk about it now.	We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Is this the first one?	Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!	I want you to calm down.
I don't know.	What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?	I don't know.
I don't know.	What did you want to happen?
What did you want to happen?	I don't know!
How long is this going to take?	We have a few more minutes.
We have a few more minutes.	I mean, when will I be normal.
I mean, when will I be normal.	We have a lot of work to do.
We have a lot of work to do.	Will I ever be normal?
Will I ever be normal?	I couldn't say.
I couldn't say.	You couldn't say.
You couldn't say.	I'm afraid not.
I'm afraid not.	"Do you know what ""normal"" is?"
"Do you know what ""normal"" is?"	I suppose it's however society defines it.
I suppose it's however society defines it.	How do you define it?
They usually tell me.	How do they know?
How do they know?	What is your idea of being normal?
What is your idea of being normal?	What is your idea of being a Jew?
Fuck you, Rosen!	I know --
I know --	You don't know!
You don't know!	I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
How do you feel about that?	I don't feel anything.
I don't feel anything.	You have no feelings for your niece?
Then why are you talking about this?	Have to talk about something.
Have to talk about something.	What are you afraid will happen?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?	I'm not that crazy.
I'm not that crazy.	Do you think you're crazy?
Why do you think you're here?	You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.	Is that what you are angry about?
Is that what you are angry about?	Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
How's the journal?	I'm still thinking about it.
I'm still thinking about it.	I wish you'd give it a try.
No fucking way.	Then think about it.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.	I don't understand.
You think reflection is good.	It's very good, indeed.
And how's your job?	The job's okay.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.	You seem a little hostile today.
You seem a little hostile today.	That was a joke.
I heard they were filthy birds.	Not when they fly.
I didn't sleep well.	Do you want to talk about it?
Do you want to talk about it?	I need a shower.
Sneak up behind me like that.	What's your fucking problem?
What's your fucking problem?	Why's it always my fucking problem?
Don't be scared, Walter.	I'm not scared.
I don't even know how to live with myself.	Just think about it.
Just think about it.	I've got problems.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.	Guess that makes you pretty special.
Guess that makes you pretty special.	That's not what I meant.
It's a bad idea.	I think it's a fucking good idea.
I'm not scared.	Neither am I.
Neither am I.	Maybe you should be.
I got poked around... here and there.	Which brother did this?
Which brother did this?	All three -- in chronological order.
All three -- in chronological order.	You must hate your brothers.
You must hate your brothers.	I love my brothers.
I love my brothers.	No you don't.
You never asked them about it?	Are you serious?
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...	Their power. They seduce me.
Their power. They seduce me.	They seduce you?
They seduce you?	I was always the one seduced.
I was always the one seduced.	You really believe that?
You really believe that?	No. That's what I used to tell myself.
No. That's what I used to tell myself.	And what do you tell yourself now?
And what do you tell yourself now?	Nothing. It's over.
What was prison like?	You don't really --
You don't really --	Yes! I want to know.
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?	No. Never again.
Why don't you just go now, okay?	I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Get your kicks somewhere else.	Hey, I'm not --
Hey, I'm not --	Depraved? My mistake.
I never hurt them. Never.	Twelve years in prison?
What did you do to them?	It's not what you think.
Look, you can go now.	How many girls did you molest?
You're not joking.	Twelve years in prison is no joke.
So, what did you do?	I molested little girls.
I molested little girls.	Molested little girls?
Why do you want to know?	Because I like you.
Did I say something wrong?	I suffer from insomnia.
I suffer from insomnia.	Is that all?
What's the problem?	You think I have a problem?
It's been a while since...	Since you've had sex?
Hey, that was... intense.	You're still here.
You're still here.	I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.	Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.

You done impressing yourself, ace?	No way that could just be seawater.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.	Piece of cake, baby.

Well, that's that.	Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
You totaled it, huh?	Yeah.  So sue me.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.	Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.	Not in this thing.
You owe me one, Virgil.	Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.	Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?

What do you think he saw?	I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
I haven't worn mine in months.	Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
I think you were worried about me.	That must be it.
You wanna know what I think?	Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.	Not for long.
I can't believe you let them do this!	Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.

How are you?	Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
Claudia, aren't you coming?	I'm certainly not going to swim across.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.	We'll send the raft back to you.
Which one shall I wear?	This one is gorgeous.
This one is gorgeous.	Then why don't you try it on?
And have you any other truths to tell me?	You already know what they are.

I don't love you.	I deserve it.
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.	Aren't you going to change?
Aren't you going to change?	You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
Then I'll see you later.	Okay. In a few minutes.
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?	So, you wonder why?
But why am I so infatuated with you?	Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...	Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
Claudia, let's get married?	What! Get married?
Does it please you to say such things?	Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...	Then why do you say them?
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.	Are you joking?
Claudia, listen to me...	No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...

Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?	And why haven't they left each other?
Shall we go for a swim?	Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
Don't be so humble.	How should I be ... arrogant?
How should I be ... arrogant?	But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
Patrizia, I'm afraid.	More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?	I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.	What do you mean by sensible?
What do you mean by sensible?	It means being without money.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?	Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
I'm not coming.	But then why did you bother changing?
You say that just to flatter me.	Do you consider that a compliment?
But where did you finally end up?	It was futile. We went all over.
Have you ever been in love?	Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?	I would say he's pretty depraved.
I would say he's pretty depraved.	Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.	But why all nudes?
Please, you come too...	But for what reason should I come there?

Leave them drums alone.	Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Ever seen one of these before?	Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Ah ... a shamus, eh?	I see you go to the night court.
I see you go to the night court.	I've made the scene.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?	Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?	No. I don't.
I don't snore.	You do - repeatedly.
You do - repeatedly.	Do I snore?
But I won't.	You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.	I don't care.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?	I beg your pardon?
Get him out of here!!	Have I said something amiss?
Have I said something amiss?	Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
Of course I can.	I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?	I'll have a bash.
I'm afraid I don't understand.	Oh, my God, he's a natural.
That's not your Grandfather.	It is, y'know.
It is, y'know.	But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Oh, there you are!	Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.	I'll look in here again.
Should I say it?	Follow your impulse.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.	He comes from a large family.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.	Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
No, I didn't you did ...	Well, what happened?
Morning!  Who's that little old man?	It's Paul's grandfather.
It's Paul's grandfather.	Oh aye, but I thought ...
But that's not like a real person at all.	Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?	They ought to be.
I'm not ...	Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Aye, I knew you were.	What's that mean?
The big hammer?	Oh aye, a sledge.
Oh aye, a sledge.	But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
Are you supposed to be here?	I've got you worried, haven't I?
I've got you worried, haven't I?	I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?	How'd you guess?
How'd you guess?	Oh, it's the way you talk.
Oh, it's the way you talk.	Is it ... is it, really?
Is it ... is it, really?	Are you pulling my leg?
Are you pulling my leg?	Something like that.
Something like that.	I see.  Do you like the play?
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.	Go away! You've spoilt it.
Go away! You've spoilt it.	Oh, sorry I spoke.
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.	Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Where are you off to?	I'm going parading before it's too late!
You're only right.	I'm not wrong.
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.	What's that mean?
Yeah ... that's right.	And what's it all come to in the end?
And what's it all come to in the end?	Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Would you two like a cup of tea?	You see, sly villains.
And we're looking after him, are we?	I'll look after meself.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.	Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?	Yeah ... so what?
Yeah ... so what?	Why do you always use your left hand?
Why do you always use your left hand?	Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.	Oh, well that's all right.  What?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.	You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
No, that's his other one.	That's all right then.
That's all right then.	Clean though, isn't he?
Clean though, isn't he?	Oh yes, he's clean all right.
What's old got to do with it?	You needn't bother.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.	Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Let's go and muck in.	Aye, before anyone stops us.
I hope he fell off.	Don't be callous.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!	He's got you worried, then?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?	Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?	Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
What little old man?	That little old man.
That little old man.	Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Tonight? We can't make it ...	You've got a midnight matinee.
You've got a midnight matinee.	Now, look here, Norm ...
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.	Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.	Sit down, the lot of you.
Let's have you.	Come on speedy!
Now get on with it.	We were going to do it.
We were going to do it.	Aye, well, now!
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.	Well you're not going.
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?	Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.	No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?	You're a swine, isn't he George?
And my nose...	Well, yes your nose is. Very.
I would have said so.	Aye, but you know him well.
Aye, but you know him well.	No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.	That's what you tell me.
That's what you tell me.	What have you heard?
What have you heard?	It's all over the place, everyone knows.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.	Is it? Is it really?
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...	No, not me.
No, not me.	Oh you are, I know you are.
Oh you are, I know you are.	No, I'm not.
I'm not, no.	Well, you look like him.
He's betrayed the class.	Oh, leave off!!!
It'll only get you into trouble.	Aah, shurrup, misery!
You're a window rattler, son.	Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Where's my grandfather?	Don't start. Look.
I've got the stuff. Come here.	Aren't we ...
Aren't we ...	No, we're not!
Eh, where's my grandfather?	Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.	Aye, I suppose so.
Do I have to raise me voice?	Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
What do you think are you're up to?	Someone put it on me.
Stop picking on him.	I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.	Good lad, Ringo.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.	Clever.  George.
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.	You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?	Down the ... er ...
Down the ... er ...	Oh, down the ... er ...?
Oh, down the ... er ...?	Yeah, down the ... er ...
Yeah, down the ... er ...	Well, give a couple of minutes ...
Yeah, you want to watch it.	It's not my fault.
It's not my fault.	Well, you stick to that story, son.
Well, you stick to that story, son.	I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.	I'll set John on you!
I'll set John on you!	Oh, anything you say, Paul.
Eh, what's all this?	Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Oh, a little savage, is he?	A proper Aborigine.
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?	... I don't know...
... I don't know...	Do you remember the pyramid?
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.	Or something will be able to see us.
Oh... God... am I cold...	Is that you, Roby?
Is that you, Roby?	I feel like shit...
I feel like shit...	Yeah, it's you all right.
How do you feel, Dell?	Wretched.  What happened to me?
Wretched.  What happened to me?	Don't you remember?
Don't you remember?	Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
Can we come up?	No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.	Can you see anything in the hole?
Maybe we can get in by the top.	You want to try?
What is it?	Take a look.
I'll go first.	No, you'll follow me.
Close enough to walk to!	Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
Is it solid?	It's... basalt.  Rock.
It's... basalt.  Rock.	Then take her down.
Can you get it a little closer?	That's what I'm going to do.
I got it.  Oh boy.	Where the hell are we?
I don't recognize that constellation.	Dell, plot our location.
I have recorded the transmission.	Play it for us, please.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --	Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.	What?  <u>Why</u>?
What?  <u>Why</u>?	I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
What happened to the lights?	Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
You like this shit?	It grows on you.
It grows on you.	You know what they make this stuff out of?
How long to fix?	Hard to say.
Hard to say.	Well, get started.
Well, get started.	Right.  Talk to you.
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.	Has the hull been breached?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.	The water will still recycle.
Oh, no.  Oh, no.	What was that?  What the Christ was that?
Oh -- God -- oh --	Is it alive?
What the hell's going on?	Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.	Hurt!  How?
Might even incinerate the damn thing.	I hope not.
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!	Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
It's really on there tight.	Here, let me try.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?	Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...	And when will you be ready to do that?
And when will you be ready to do that?	Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.	Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
It makes me sick to see him like that.	Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
God, that smoke's poisonous!	It's eating a hole in the floor!
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.	Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
Where did it come from?	<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.	How does he breathe?
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.	Let me go first; you stay behind me.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.	Should we go outside and bring him in?
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.	The flamethrower needs more fuel.
We've got six hours left.	Oh my God.
Oh my God.	Does anybody know what happened?
Sounds like a rough one.	Got a better idea?
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.	I'll come with you.
There.  Should be coming through about there.	Careful, don't get under it!
It's over, Hunter.	Boy, that's terrific.
Boy, that's terrific.	Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
We can use the flamethrower.	It's not going to work.
Don't count on it.	We sure need this flamethrower.
What common objects?	Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
This is horrible.	Hey!  what about the film?
What's happening up here?	I think it's fizzled out.
Look at that.	What is it -- I can't tell anything --
What do you mean, no?	We're not going anywhere.
Now what's wrong?	I've completely lost their signal.
I've completely lost their signal.	Can you get them back?
Are they close?	They're on the next level up.
They're on the next level up.	Let's get moving with this net.
The commander normally has first publication rights.	Maybe we could write it together.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.	We're going into the freezers now.
No, thank God... just missed him.	Is it still dripping?
Is it still dripping?	It appears to have healed itself.
It won't come -- it's stuck.	What is it?
<u>What is it</u>?	<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
No, it's coming.	Can you see anything?
What'd he say?	I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
This looks ancient.	Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?	What's the frequency?
What's the frequency?	Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?	Feast your eyes.
That tube must be depositing it in him.	Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...	I'll get you out of there.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...	What can I do?
<u>Hey watch it</u>!	It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
Which presumably means...	... More spores coming.
Can you make out any pattern in all that?	Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
Two down, four to go.	What's that supposed to mean?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?	By eating our food supplies.
What's it doing, having a seizure?	It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Take us up.	Up one kilometer, Jay.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.	Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
Hey, can you guys hear me?	Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Find anything we missed?	I don't even know what I'm looking for.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.	Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?	Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.	Good!  Moisture content?
Good!  Moisture content?	Zero.  Dry as a bone.
What the hell happened?	Engine room, what happened?
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.	Turn on navigation lights.
It's out of focus.	No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Oh my God.	Well, it's finally happened.
Where are we?	Sandy, contact traffic control.
What is it?	It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.	Do you want a tablet?
Headache?  Dehydration?	The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Let's get back and call this in.	Wait a minute.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?	Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Yeah, it's fine.	God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.	I told you we... what's that?
It's a rhino.	Is it dead?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.	Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.	Get her on-line.  Now!
Where is she?	Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Are you alright?	What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
Give or take.	We're not gonna make it, are we?
What do you need?	A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.	It's on the board.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?	Okay, give me the numbers.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.	You win some, you loose some.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.	Shit.  When?
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.	Has anybody talked to them?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!	It's alright, it's cool...
It's alright, it's cool...	Is it still moving?
What?  Where?	Just behind us, over to the right.
Still got him?	It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
Careful of that edging there...	Yeah, I got it.
But I'm going first...	Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Forget it, man.	C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Okay, I'm out of here!	Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
Okay, we're in business.	Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
They knocked out the external feeds.	Looks like it.
I... I can't!	You have to...
Hurry it up.	Don't wait for me!
That's the wrong way!	Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Think I spoke too soon...	Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Yeah.  Somebody won.	Check out the tent.
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?	Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
What is that?	Real man' drink.
And before that?	Six month stint on Datus.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?	Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
You should hit the sack, too.	Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.	What time's sundown?
What time's sundown?	'Bout five minutes.
'Bout five minutes.	Give me a yell is something happens.
Give me a yell is something happens.	You got it, cowboy.
How's it going?	Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.	Tactical nukes, maybe?
How do you know my name?	It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.	And what is your name?
I don't suppose there's a drink left...	You can have one at Max's.
You can have one at Max's.	I don't think I'm going.
No, it's not.  It's for this.	It's the same thing, isn't it?
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.	What of it?
What have you got to do with it?	Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.	I can't believe my ears...
I can't believe my ears...	A dull cliche.
What do you take me for?	I don't know what I take you for anything...
I never intended you to be.	Yes, you did. You still do.
... and Karen.	She doesn't know.
I'm in love with Lloyd!	Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-	You have no right to say such things!
All paved with diamonds and gold?	You know me better than that.
You know me better than that.	Paved with what, then?
I don't think that's funny.	It wasn't meant to be.
Just like that, eh?	Just like that.
Just some coffee.	I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
You take charge.	I believe I will.
You're more than modest.	It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
May I come in?	Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?	That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Feeling better, my dear?	Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?	Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
She was magnificent.	Then you've heard too.
Then you've heard too.	I was there. An eyewitness.
I was there. An eyewitness.	You were there? At the play - last night?
You were there? At the play - last night?	A happy coincidence.
How... how was Miss Caswell?	Frankly, I don't remember.
Frankly, I don't remember.	Just slipped your mind.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.	Eve! My understudy...
Eve! My understudy...	Didn't you know?
Didn't you know?	Of course I knew.
Of course I knew.	It just slipped your mind.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?	Being violently ill to her tummy.
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-	We have that in common.
We have that in common.	Then you two must have a long talk-
Good luck, genius...	Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
A married lady.	With the paper to prove it.
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?	What would you like? Texas?
He does not exaggerate. I was good.	You were great.
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?	That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
It's obvious you're not a woman.	I've been aware of that for some time.
I've been aware of that for some time.	Well, I am.
Don't be condescending.	Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Margo, let's make peace.	The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
I wish it were.	Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
I must have frightened her away.	I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Don't mix your metaphors.	I mix what I like.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.	What a body, what a voice.
What a body, what a voice.	The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!	The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.	I will not calm down!
I will not calm down!	Don't calm down.
Don't calm down.	You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?	I'm trying terribly hard.
What fire and music?	You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
It's all over.	What's all over?
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?	You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
For instance what?	For instance - you!
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...	I thought you were going to be late-
I thought you were going to be late-	When I'm guest of honor?
When I'm guest of honor?	I had no idea you were even here.
She's a girl of so many interests.	It's a pretty rare quality these days.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.	She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.	So she seems.
Happy little housewife...	Cut it out.
It's a good thought.	It won't play.
Many happy returns of the day...	I get a party, don't I?
I get a party, don't I?	Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
Yeah... I will.	How is Eve? Okay?
I love you...	I'll check with Eve...
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-	Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?	You're my girl, aren't you?
You're my girl, aren't you?	That I am...
That I am...	Then you're crazy.
Then you're crazy.	When - when are you coming back?
Knit me a muffler.	Call me when you get in...
Take care of yourself out there...	I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.	- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
And cut that out right now.	Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?	As of this moment you're six years old...
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...	Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.	Like a nylon lemon peel-
Like a nylon lemon peel-	Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...	Where's my coat?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...	I'm a junk yard.
Don't run away, Bill.	From what would I be running?
Your make-up's a little heavy.	- and for you.
- and for you.	You're quite a girl.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?	You hear all kinds of things.
Is that what you want me to be?	I'm talking about you. And what you want.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.	So am I.
So am I.	What have I got to do with it?
Thanks for your help... good luck.	Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?	Of course not.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.	Also Addison deWitt.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.	It's only one picture deal.
It's only one picture deal.	So few come back...
I just wondered.	Just wondered what?
Why you have to go out there.	I don't have to. I want to.
I don't have to. I want to.	Is it the money?
Is it the money?	Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
Hello, what's your name?	Eve. Eve Harrington.
What did you expect - live sables?	A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
Lemme fix you a drink.	No thanks, Birdie.
You all put together?	My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.	That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Late for what?	Don't be dense. The party.
Don't be dense. The party.	I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
You don't like Eve, do you?	Do you want an argument or an answer?
Now you want an argument.	She works hard.
She works hard.	Night an' day.
Night an' day.	She's loyal and efficient-
She's loyal and efficient-	Like an agent with one client.
Like an agent with one client.	She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?	Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...	How do you mean that?
Behind in your dues? How much?	I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Kill the people.  Got your key?	See you home...
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.	Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-	I never played Fort Sumter.
That's the door.	You rest. I'll get it...
How long does it take?	With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.	I'll just pick up the broken glass.
It was for my report.	What report? To whom?
What are you doing here?	I - I guess I fell asleep.
Addison wants me to play it.	Over my dead body...
I think I know...	Something most important you can do.
Eve... don't cry.	I'm not crying.
But the raves about your performance-	- an understudy's performance.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...	He can help you.
There can't be very much-	Oh, but there is-
Oh, but there is-	- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.	Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.	I don't intend to be.
I don't intend to be.	Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.	They certainly don't waste much time.
They certainly don't waste much time.	Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
May I have your coat?	Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
You won't forget it?	I won't forget.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?	I think she would cheer.
I think she would cheer.	But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-	They'll do as they're told.
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-	I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-	Not just that way. As a friend...
Not just that way. As a friend...	I'd like that.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?	It couldn't possibly interest you.
I thought you'd forgotten about me.	Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...	Not at all.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.	He's the best.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.	I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
Hello, Miss Harrington.	How do you do, Mr. Richards.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.	I had no idea you knew each other.
If you'd like.	I wouldn't like.
There's the script to go back to the Guild-	I've got it.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-	Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...	Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Well, you've done so much... what's new?	The curtains. I made them myself.
The curtains. I made them myself.	They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Well - if I'm not in the way...	I won't be a minute.
There are other plays...	Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
What about Bill?	What about Bill?
What about Bill?	He's in love with you.
Not to you. Not to Bill.	Isn't that what they always say?
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.	We've all seemed a little tense lately...
Do you want it on?	It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.	I detest cheap sentiment.
How much time have we?	Roughly ten minutes.
Roughly ten minutes.	How far to the station?
How far to the station?	Three or four miles...
Three or four miles...	Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?	None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...	Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
Who is it? What's it all about?	Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
- well? What happened?	Nothing much. She apologized.
I'm glad Bill's back.	They'd die without each other.
I'm beginning to catch up.	If we could cast it properly, that is...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.	Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
Lloyd, be careful...	Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
I mean really, deeply angry...	I don't think I could be.
I don't think I could be.	"Well. I don't want to play ""Cora."""
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.	You know, she probably means well, after all...
You know, she probably means well, after all...	She is a louse.
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.	Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.
Karen and I just don't want an accident-	I have no intention of having an accident!
She was a revelation...	To you, too?
To you, too?	What do you mean?
She's your understudy.	Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
How's the new one coming?	The play? All right, I guess...
The play? All right, I guess...	"""Cora."" She's - still a girl of twenty?"
"""Cora."" She's - still a girl of twenty?"	Twentyish. It isn't important.
Twentyish. It isn't important.	Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?	How do you mean?
How do you mean?	Don't be evasive.
Don't be evasive.	Margo, you haven't got any age.
Margo, you haven't got any age.	Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?	Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.	When you do, let me in on it.
Where is she?	Up in the room.
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...	... Among so many quiet qualities.
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...	Call, what call?
Call, what call?	It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?	That's right, but I don't understand-
I just played it.	Play it again.
Play it again.	But that was the fourth straight time.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?	Are you breaking the contract?
Are you breaking the contract?	Answer my question!
Answer my question!	Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.	I didn't hear you.
I didn't hear you.	I said I'm a dying man!
I said I'm a dying man!	Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.	When's the audition?
When's the audition?	A couple of weeks.
A couple of weeks.	I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Anything to help you out, Max.	This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
All you got to do is name it.	Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
Miss Caswell?  What?	An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?	I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.	It's nothing personal, though.
It's nothing personal, though.	What's the matter?
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.	Maybe we are...
He'll give us a sworn statement.	We're inside the White House now.
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--	--I haven't said anything--
--we gotta top the Times--	--I know, I know--
--shit, who do we know?--	--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--	--has he got an ax?--
You want me to be the bastard.	And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.	It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.	That happens to people.  OK, go on.
Did he just say what I think he said?	You voted for him.
I hate both parties.	And I'm a Republican.
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.	I never scared anyone before.
Facts or theory?	Anything you've got.
I don't get it... this really was my turf...	You're not a kid anymore.
Why didn't we get that?	Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--	--you do?--with access to records?
That was fun.  What now?	I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.	And you haven't called him?--
July of '71.	About the past year.
--what do you think?--	--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.	Maybe a political operative of some sort--
Maybe a political operative of some sort--	--a spy, you mean?
All right, what do we know?	Let me lay a little theory on you--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?	Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--	--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--	--it was fine the way it was--
--it was fine the way it was--	--it was bullshit the way it was--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--	--what time is it?
I'll never get out of here in time.	The telephone calls... we know about that.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?	I'm on deadline.
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?	Well of course.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?	He is not in the car.  Sorry.
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.	I'm so glad.
I'm so glad.	I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.	And you will.  But not now.
Any idea what he did?	Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
Chapin did contact you then?	Sure--off the record.
Sure--off the record.	On the orders of Haldeman?
Do you feel much about the things you did?	I didn't do anything wrong.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Tell that to Muskie.
Tell that to Muskie.	Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
I know where Dwight works.	When did he hire you?
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--	--that was awhile ago--
I thought you had to get to Miami.	There's always a later plane.
There's always a later plane.	You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
Five hundred; six maybe.	You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
Give me your checkbook then.	It's right under that pile.
The ones who could disburse the money.	Who were they?
...No... never in so many words...	It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
You've really got to go.	Just let me get a match.
So tell me about the Times article.	What do you want to know?
What do you want to know?	No games, Irwin; give.
Something maybe big.	And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?	Just tell me about the goddamn article.
--that leaves Haldeman, period.	I'm not your source on that.
I really can't talk now--	--this'll only take one second--
But they both worked at the White House?	I will not talk about the other two.
I will not talk about the other two.	Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--	--they're worse. That's why I quit.
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--	--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
I got Clawsen on hold--	--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--his dialing finger must be falling off--	--what do you think?--
--what do you think?--	--he went to her apartment and he told her--
Just tell me his title.	I don't know titles.
They are not my clients.	You're a lawyer and you're here--
Are you implying you don't believe me?	I have nothing more to say.
I have nothing more to say.	You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
What I don't understand is how you got here.	I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
Look, I told you inside--	--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?	Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Where?  What do you mean, where?	Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
There were more then.	Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--	--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--	--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.	Who?--be specific. How high up?
Who?--be specific. How high up?	You'll have to find that out, won't you.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?	Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?	I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Howard Hunt here.	Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--	--yes, yes, what is it?
Government. Recently retired.	Where in government?
Where in government?	...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?	Nobody ever had too much.
I think so.	Are you sure?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?	I couldn't say.
I couldn't say.	But it's possible.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.	I really want to know.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--	--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
...go on, go on...	That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?	Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--	--maybe I'm tense--
--has any of them got an ax?--	--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
--remember Toronto, Harry.	That was awhile ago.
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.	No, none of those.
A boy or a girl?	A girl. Melissa.
Haldeman.  Right?	I won't talk about the other two.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.	And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?	When so ordered.
The what to what?	You work there, Miss Abbott.
You work there, Miss Abbott.	I'm not Miss Abbott.
I'll do it.	Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
No, it was good.	Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
You're a killer, Ozzy!	-- Thanks, coach --
I had no idea you'd be this good!	Neither did I!
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?	Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?	Yes ma'am, I am.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?	I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!	Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Why is this?	You're gonna shit your pants!
Of course, Finch.  What?	Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.	What are we gonna hear?
What are we gonna hear?	You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Oz, it's okay, I know.	You called me Oz.
What about the game?!	I'm not playing.
I'm not playing.	You're missing the game for us?!
You're missing the game for us?!	No.  I'm missing the game for you.

How did you know I was here?	Stifler told me.
Stifler told me.	You talked to Stifler?
Why are you doing this?	Because I want to.
I wasn't making fun of you.	Give me a break, you're so full of it.
I'm glad you think so.	You don't like it?
You can call me Oz.	Do I have to?
Do I have to?	You can call me Ostreicher.

Are you kidding?  No.	Then what the hell are you talking about?
You mean...and orgasm?	You got it, stud.
You got it, stud.	Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --	No you haven't.
No you haven't.	But that one time --

Don't you love my sexy body?!	I do, baby, I do.

Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.	Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Did I miss anything?!	Just in time.
Hey, where's Finch?	Went home to shit.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.	Right.  That gives us...
Right.  That gives us...	Exactly three weeks to the day.
Ow, what the hell?	Sorry, I thought you were dead.
You can crash at Stifler's?	It's all good.  Breath check.

And you said...	Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Nothing, I just hugged her back.	You think she was serious?
Son.  This lady's here for you.	I know.  Hey Nadia.
Dad!  I know!	Do you know about the clitoris?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.	Thank you, dad, I got it.
Thank you, dad, I got it.	Okay, well that about covers it.
I know, Dad.	Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?	Don't you want me to?
Don't you want me to?	Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!	I told you.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?	Yes.  Seriously.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.	After getting laid?
After getting laid?	After high school.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.	Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
I still think you're okay.	So do I, Kev.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?	Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.	Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
You guys got the Latin homework?	No -- Kevin, you?
She's a mermaid, dude.	Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.	She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.	A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.	Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
What's up, fellas?	Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
You've got something going?	Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.	Nadia, I can't --
So you need to change, right?	Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Yes.  No.  Yes.	Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?	Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!	God dammit, Stifler!
God dammit, Stifler!	Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.	Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Victoria...I love you.	I love you.
I don't know.  How do you?	Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
You sure you're comfortable?	Yeah.  Are you sure?
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?	Yeah, right here.
See -- this is the nicest room.	Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.	Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
I think you're so right, Kevin.	You want to do it?
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!	Just a second!
Let me know.	Okay, don't stop.
Kevin, this is serious!	You got in.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.	You think so?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.	What?!  How do I do that?
Qualify for what?	You've just inherited The Bible.
Have you ever heard of the bible?	What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Does it tell me how to get laid?	You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.	Ready for what?
Ready for what?	Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.	Fuck yeah we will.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?	I think we're falling in love.
I guess we'll call you two-ply.	Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
So does your tongue cramp up?	Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.	Dude, prom sucks.
Feeling better, Oz?	I'm such a loser.
I'm such a loser.	That's the spirit.
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.	You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
You ever hear of something called The Bible?	Once, in church, dude.
Then she said -- she loves me.	Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.	Come on, you know the words, sing along.
I think you need your balls reattached.	Keep it down, dude.
Keep it down, dude.	What the fuck are you doing here?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!	Shut the fuck up.
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?	Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.	That junior chick?
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!	Bullshit.  From where?
Bullshit.  From where?	She works part-time at my dad's store.
Either way works for us...	But you better hurry.

Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.	Well, they are French.

Are you sure? How's your knee?	I'm fine all over.
I'm fine all over.	Mind if I come in?
Mind if I come in?	Of course not.
That's very wise.	Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.	Good night, Miss Kubelik.
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?	Fine. How's your eye?

Shall I light the candles?	It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
Are we dressing for dinner?	No -- just come as you are.
No -- just come as you are.	Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.	I guess so.
I guess so.	I know so. He's a taker.
Are you all right?	Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?	Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.	Are you supposed to?
Are you supposed to?	In this house, you're supposed to.

You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.	Was he really upset when you told him?
Was he really upset when you told him?	Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
I'm sure that's the explanation.	You really think so?
You really think so?	No doubt about it.
No doubt about it.	Can I have that pad and the pencil?
I think I'm going to give it all up.	Give what up?
Give what up?	Why do people have to love people, anyway?

I am. Let me get the cards.	You don't have to entertain me.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.	That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
He doesn't give a damn about me.	Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
When are you coming home?	As soon as I can walk.
As soon as I can walk.	Something wrong with your legs?
Something wrong with your legs?	No -- it's my stomach.
Someone from the office.	And where are you now?

Here. How about some breakfast?	No -- I don't want anything.
No -- I don't want anything.	I'll fix you some coffee.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --	I just want to go brush my teeth --
What is it?	The mirror -- it's broken.
I think so.	You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?	No -- I like it.
This is a bad day for me.	I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
You all right? What's the matter?	Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.	You're so right.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.	What gave you that idea?
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.	I forgive you.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.	Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?	Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.	Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?	No. Like a man.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.	Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
You should have stayed in bed this morning.	I should have stayed in bed last night.
Say, you got a lulu.	Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.	Oh, I never catch colds.
Morning, Mr. Baxter.	Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.	Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.	No I didn't.
No I didn't.	But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Now you're being bright?	Thank you, sir.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.	Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.	What do you mean, sorry?
What do you mean, sorry?	You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.	I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.	Especially not Miss Kubelik.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.	How's that again?
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.	Put me down for Thursday again.

Yes, of course.	You know how people talk.
You know how people talk.	Oh, you don't have to worry --
Oh, you don't have to worry --	Not that I have anything to hide.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.	You too, sir.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.	How would you like to go tonight?
The Vice Squad?	That's right, Baxter.
No, no -- just had a little accident.	What does he mean, accident?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?	Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
What do you want?	What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.	Oh, I'm very grateful.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.	You threatening me?
You threatening me?	Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?	Well, I have things to do --
Well, I have things to do --	What's this -- you packing?
What's this -- you packing?	Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.

The party's over.	What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?	It's an emergency -- see you some other time.

If you'll just listen to me for a minute --	Okay. I'm sorry.
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.	Are you sure that's what you want?
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?	No. I have a date at eight-thirty.

About what ?	I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.	But why ?
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.	Okay, Willard, sit down.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.	Do you know that jungle?
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.	Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --	As I said, we can pay you in gold.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.	Entirely unnecessary, Captain.

This one , Lance?	Yeah, Jesus Christ !
No -- no, Captain.	Which one's the Colonel's?
Which one's the Colonel's?	The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.

Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.	Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
This boat's a mess.	Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Why did they attack us?	Simple. They don't want him to go.
So Kurtz is alive.	Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
What if I say no.	Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Are you warm, Captain?	The river is beautiful.
What's a big question?	Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?	No. Not really.
I should be checking on the boat.	The war will still be here tomorrow.
Right now -- I am.	Well who the hell verifies that ?
Where's your chief supply officer?	Beverly Hills --
You came right to it, son of a bitch --	Son of a bitch, sir.

I can trust my brain.	That seems like a good choice.
I'll take a bus.	I'll take you... why not?
I don't want to hear that music right now.	What do you mean? You said you liked it.
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.	Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
Sex with Simon?	It's one idea...
I'll never forget you said it.	It was a mistake.
And mean it...	Can we order first?

How do you know about my mother?	I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
So what are you doing with a dog?	Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.	You're not worried that someone might take him?
You're not worried that someone might take him?	Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?	What do you care?
I know. He's just the best.	I've got Jews at my table.
I love you...  Let him take you home.	Don't want to. I love you.
One night with me!	You think you're kidding.
But what about...	I'll take care of myself --
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.	Stop staring. Do a vase.
Stop staring. Do a vase.	But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.	Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
Can you not be violent?	I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
Why? What have you been thinking about?	How to die, mostly.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?	Yes. I really would.
What the heck are those for?	No. No. Get Carol.
What are you trying to do to me?	What the heck do you mean?
You changed the room around...	Two years ago...
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.	So am I, Frank.
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?	Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.	How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?	Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?	Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
"""What?"" Look at you... You sense a mark."	Hey -- you called me... I...
Hey -- you called me... I...	About a dog.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.	No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.	Okay by me.
How's Verdell doing?	He's a pain in the ass.
I'm not saying nothing to you.	Thanks for looking after him.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.	Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Shall I get her for you?	No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
No. Please, don't force him.	You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Just move on. No one here killed him.	Oh, is he dead?
Because...  ... you love her?	No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.	"Okay... you tell me why --  ""You're dying here."""
Picking on me won't help.	Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.	But you know where you're lucky?
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.	They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?	I love you.
I think you gotta camp it here...	What are you talking about?
Another place where?	Does it matter?
You consider your life easy.	I give you that one...  Nice packing.
That's very thoughtful.	Never a break. Never.
Would you leave now, please?	Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
I carry bacon in my pocket.	Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.	Now we'll both call him.
Now we'll both call him.	Come on, sweetheart...
Come on, sweetheart...	Yo, yo, yo...
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.	Rot in hell, Melvin.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.	It smells like shit in here?
That cleaning woman doesn't...	Please, just leave.
Please, just leave.	Where are all your queer party friends?
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.	Thank you for walking him.
Did you... do something to him?	Do you realize that I work at him?
Do you realize that I work at him?	No, I didn't.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.	Well, that's a load off.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.	'Love was... '
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.	How're you doing?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.	Just a second -- he has to go.
So what happens now?	We go around once.
Bain.  Michael Bain.	How long have you been freelance?
How long have you been freelance?	Two years.  Two long fucking years.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.	Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.	No fucking way.
You're right.  Talking too much again.	Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.	What?  You think I'm running you up?
What?  You think I'm running you up?	Just do your job.
Where you from?	What is this?
What is this?	Not too good at small talk, eh?
So you're from around here?	No.  No I'm not.
Is there a problem?	No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
How in the fuck do you know that?	Do you want Rath or not?
I'm on the scent.	You're too late.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.	Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Who is the mark?	Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
I don't know what the fuck you are.	I know.  It was a joke.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.	I'm worried about you, Robert.
Where have you been, Robert?	Sick.  The flu.
Sick.  The flu.	I don't believe you.
Is this how it went, Nick?	Robert?  Robert?
I know what happened.	I bet you fucking know!
I bet you fucking know!	It cost us.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!	Oh, God.  I see it!
That doesn't sound normal.	I'm not normal.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.	Attraction is a complication?
Attraction is a complication?	It can be.
It can be.	It happened to you before?
Who was she?	Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.	What happened to her?
What happened to her?	She was taken.
She was taken.	Did you --
Did you --	No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.	Was she the only one?
Is this becoming complicated?	I'm not sure that I care anymore.
Why?  I don't know.	Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Can I ask you something?	I'm sure you will.
I'm sure you will.	Am I attractive?
And you were drilling these holes...?	So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.	Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Did you think they were newlyweds?	I didn't notice them.
I didn't notice them.	When I first saw them I thought they were married.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.	How do you know they're not?
How do you know they're not?	I went into their room this afternoon.
Jesus, if someone had --	Nobody ever sees me.
Nobody ever sees me.	Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?	I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.	They're worth less points.
I think I got one today.	Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
Ten years later, here you are again.	Yes.  Here I am again.
Sounds pretty well figured out.	I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.	I told you, he will.
Okay.  Then what?	Then, we wait.
Transmits and receives.	Cheap as shit.
How was the beach?	The beach?  It was nice.
What do you think he's doing?	I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Oh.  What do you think about?	Work.  The things I need to get done.
I don't know.	You were there?
How did you get into the business?	The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
More or less.	How old were you?
How old were you?	They recruited me when I was in high school.
They recruited me when I was in high school.	Jesus -- why?
Jesus -- why?	Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.	You were like a boy genius?
You were like a boy genius?	Some people said that.  I never thought so.
I was just different.	You went from high school to the Agency?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?	No, they didn't.
No, they didn't.	But you knew what they were training you for?
But you knew what they were training you for?	Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
The exotic women.	Women?  No... not really.
Because you are a women.	Why did you leave the Agency?
Tell me about the first time.	My first take?
Are they usually like that?	No.  Just the first one.
They become complicated... messy.	Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother you?	Did it ever bother James Bond?
He was... taken.	He was killed.
It's not the same, is it?	Better than playing with yourself.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.	Rath.  Robert Rath.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?	No.  Just Electra.
Because he is trying to retire me.	He wants to kill you?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.	And you want to use me to get him?
Until a minute ago.	What does that mean?
Okay.  How did you find me?	You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.	You didn't know anything about me.
Ten million --	Now you understand why I'm here.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.	I'm part of the game, just like you.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.	What?  How did you know I had a cat?
What?  How did you know I had a cat?	Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Get on the expressway.	Where are we going?
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?	I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Then, I'll sail alone.	Do you believe that?
Do you believe that?	Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
Do you ever think about starting over?	All the time.
All the time.	Can you tell me about it?
Do you ever regret things you've done?	Everyone regrets something.
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.	I called because I just want... I need to talk.
You're very good at this aren't you?	I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Would you like a drink?	I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
I prefer it like this.	How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Hi.  Did you call --	Yes.  Please come in.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.	Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
Why didn't you fade?	You mean quit?
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.	That's exactly what I told myself.
You're pretty famous aren't you?	I hope not.
How much farther?	Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
This will take some time.	I have all day.
What are you having?	A coke, if they have it?
A coke, if they have it?	Hey Doug, you want a beer?
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.	And pay for their drinks occasionally.
God, I think I need a holiday.	Some deal you did there!
Did you see anything in the files?	It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Yeah, Dave Walters.	Good, what's his number?
WE gotta think of something.	Now you're using that word.
Now you're using that word.	I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Chris! Tell me some good news.	Tell me some bad news?
Tell me some bad news?	I don't want to ruin your day.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.	So I hear.
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.	He's lying! I am.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?	Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.	You capitalist pig!
My God! What happened?	I fell in love.
I fell in love.	And a tram hit you?
And a tram hit you?	No, the boyfriend.
No, the boyfriend.	What happened to Katka?
What happened to Katka?	Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?	It just happened.
A fine specimen for conversion.	What are you on about?
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.	We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.	No, We aren't going to do it.
Have you cleared all the rubble up?	No, not yet.
No, not yet.	You're all bloody useless.
Red or white?	Both, see you later.
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.	You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?	Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
Like a hand?	When your ready Son!
Am I late?	No, not if you've got better things to do.
No, not if you've got better things to do.	Who put a bee up your butt?
So why didn't we?	We don't speak Czech!
It looks new, they might miss one or two.	We're going to need it all.
We're going to need it all.	Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Destroy the evidence huh.	Have you ever stolen anything?
Like helping a sick kid?	No, for the Asylum.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.	What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.	They'll never get us.
Need any disks?	Yeah, I'll take some.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?	Is it gone four-thirty?
I'd love to get in there.	Don't we have enough already?
Don't we have enough already?	It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?	And suppose a little old lady lives there?
It must be on the other side of this.	But how did the wall get here?
Can you do the lock on it?	No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?	None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.	I've been saying that since we met.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?	No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.	Well, don't get carried away.
Tell them we're working for the University.	Thought of everything haven't you.
Thought of everything haven't you.	Yep, except a name for this place.
Yep, except a name for this place.	You're nuts man, Katka's right!
And put it on expenses?	Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
He was an electrician?	No, he was talking about girls, I think.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.	That makes you an expert I guess.
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.	We could make a run for it?
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?	It's big, right Jahn?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.	Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.	Like Custer huh?
Oh yeah, what's that?	An alternative literary venue!
An alternative literary venue!	I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!	What did the beer cost?
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.	Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
Anything in it?	No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.	Never heard of K-MART?
You guys having a go a me or what?	We're only joking.....It is your round though!
We're only joking.....It is your round though!	Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!	Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.	What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
It's that one isn't it.	Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.	Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.	Follow that Budjovice sign.
Do you know the way?	Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....	No, by road?
No, by road?	Yeah, pretty well.
Yeah, pretty well.	Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
It was a condition of getting Doug out.	What are you talking about?
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?	Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
So am I.	Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.	That's my mum's.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.	You mean your NOT going to spring me?

Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?	Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.	I've been around.
I've been around.	Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
No, it's not true, you're lying.	Not this time, Kat.
Forget about me Kat.	But I love you!

What? You are crazy!	Look, just hear me out, okay?
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?	I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.	How about you Brutus?

Yeah, but it was okay.	How did he look?
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.	I had it coming from someone.
I had it coming from someone.	Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
I'd better get you to a hospital.	I'll be okay, just get me home.
What would you like, beer?	No, just a coffee.
No, just a coffee.	One beer, one coffee, thanks.
Is it dry?	Yeah seems okay.
I figured you more as a Socialist?	I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.

No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.	We_re not all running away
We_re not all running away	I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
I thought I'd help out.	We don't need you.
I'll put one on the notice-board too.	Am I invited?
I'll need to make a phone call.	You may use my office.
I'm not sure it's possible.	The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
Why did you break into that particular building?	It was the biggest I could find.

Come on Holly!	Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
I don't want to go.	It's time to go home, Holly.
I decided to help out at the Asylum.	See you brought one of the patients with you too.
All the more reason to eliminate him.	What if his accomplices have made copies?
You are responsible...What has happened?	We're not sure...
Why are there still such headlines?	This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --	I'm sorry about how we --
That's one girl who can't take a hint.	Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
She's coming over here...	Heart be still.
What are you doing here?	He wants to talk to you.

A late night or an early morning?	Late night.  You?
Late night.  You?	Were you with Jamie?
To see your father?	No. I won't be long.
You look nice. I should have dressed.	You're fine like that, Mom.
You're fine like that, Mom.	There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Out with Belinda?	That's over. Way over.
That's over. Way over.	I can't know things if you don't tell me.
Your father dropped off an extra check.	I don't want his money.
I don't want his money.	It could help with a new car --
It could help with a new car --	-- I like the car I have.
What if they expel you?	Kelly wouldn't do that.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.	No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.	Scamming's a strong word.
She's like some Puritan.	She's not. She's got her own ideas.
Don't call him a dipshit.	You do --
You do --	And you don't.  What's she doing in there?
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.	I need to whizz.
Get yourself a glass.	No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
I'm very sorry --	What kind of a man are you, son?
Who are you?	Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
Will you do something for me?	Landon. I can't even do for myself.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.	But if you could, you would?
Can I -- go out?	You'll be fine for a few minutes.
It's gone now.	Because you have hope that you'll get better?
How're you doing?	Better. I was really angry.
You know how to waltz??	I was going to fake it.
I've talked to your father.	That's what I mean.
What are you thinking?	That I want you to take me home.
That I want you to take me home.	Now? We just --
Now? We just --	I don't want to come here anymore.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.	I used to like yogurt.
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --	I should have told you sooner --
You're worried about your college applications.	I'm not applying to college.

That what you do?	Yes. I try to keep my power.
What about your father?	I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
Are you trying to seduce me?	No. Why? Are you seducible?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.	You planned this --
You planned this --	Hoped for it.
When did you build this?	I was twelve.
What'd you tell your father?	The truth. I just left you out of it.
What would you do up here?	Look. Talk. Not talk.
Assholes. This happen to you?	Twice a year.

We can measure wind.	Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.	What do you actually know with religion?
What do you actually know with religion?	Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
You're sometimes not sure?	I'm sure. Pretty sure.
Before we do this.	We're doing something -- ?
Is there a rush?	I have to get you home by one.
I have to get you home by one.	It's only 7:30.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.	I wanted this to be a date.
She great or what?	Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?	No.  But are you -- impressed?
What does that mean?!	It means you can do anything.
So you're talking to me?	When I have something to say.
It's a start.	Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
I don't want to be just your friend --	You don't know what you want --
Maybe you inspire me.	That sounds like horseshit.
People can see.	And that would ruin your reputation how?
I haven't been nice to you.	You're hardly nice to anyone.
You were great the other night.	Thank you. So were you.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.	That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --	Then maybe you can read mine.
Or anywhere where people might see us.	Belinda's a very jealous person.
Belinda's a very jealous person.	That would be the reason.
You're not in a very good mood.	You don't miss a thing.
The play's going to be really good.	I'm really glad you think so.
He doesn't trust you.	Sometimes I don't even trust me.
You have to believe to have faith.	You don't believe in anything?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.	Your father doesn't like me.
You're really into God, right?	In ten words or less?
My relationship with God is my own.	But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Looking for intelligent life?	Looking for something -- someone.

She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.	I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
Well--yeah, I guess--	"Her ""co-star"" in the beaver picture?"
"Her ""co-star"" in the beaver picture?"	Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.	Yeah, but what about--

He's half yours, partner.	He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
What do you want me to do?	I want to see the sun rise.
"It means ""bloodbrother."""	I don't understand.
You're hurting me.	Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Anyone else make it?	I don't think so.
Where to first?	The House of Pain.
"Then they weren't created to go after your ""patient zero""."	No.  They've been training to hunt you.
What's your problem, Whistler?	Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Your security's for shit, kid.	Where the hell have you been?
Where the hell have you been?	Just out connecting a few dots.
Where were you, Whistler?	I'll show you.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.	Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I don't like it.	I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
What do you think?	Sounds like a plan.
Sounds like a plan.	What do you really think?
You came back for me.	Did you think I wouldn't?
Did you think I wouldn't?	Took you long enough.
How do you feel?	Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
Put it back in park, Blade.	Thought you were dead.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.	You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
What's going on?	He was here.  Watching us.
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.	I don't know about this, man --

Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!	Maybe it's better that way.
From his father, of course.	You experimented on your own, son?
Not that I'm in contact with.	Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.	You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Nope.  Back then we did not.	So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?	Going on twenty years now.
Going on twenty years now.	Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?	Look, what's your problem?
What took you so long?	Don't even start, old man.
She's been bitten.	You should've killed her, then.
You should've killed her, then.	She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
You're too human, Blade.	It's because I'm human that I can do this.
Beautiful day, isn't it?	How can you be out here?
I am tired. Dawn is coming.	But I just got here --
But I just got here --	You've been here longer than you think.
Who is LaMagra?	The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
Is something wrong, my friend?	You're blind --

Get out of here --	I'm not leaving without you.
I'm not leaving without you.	You don't understand. The Thirst --
It won't work on you.	What are you talking about?
Are you all right?	I've been better --
I've been better --	How long have we been driving?
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.	You make it sound like I'm already dead.
Some. It's been slow --	You don't look so good.
You don't look so good.	I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
It's dark in here.	You get used to the darkness.

You're hurt --	Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
What is this place?	Some kind of archive --
How can you tell?	The way they move, they way they smell --
What are you looking at?	What do you see here?
There is no cure.	You don't know that.
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.	It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
And that's a good thing?	For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
You used me as bait?!	It worked, didn't it?
It worked, didn't it?	But, he could've --
But, he could've --	He didn't. Get over it.

Deacon brought me back.	Fight him --
You haven't started in on the internal organs?	Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?	This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
This isn't human blood.	Then what is it?
What happened to the power?	I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.	Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
Why do you hunt them?	Habit, mostly, just like this.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?	We weren't sure we could trust you.
We keep in radio contact.	You've been listening in the whole time?

You were brilliant today.	It's only the beginning.
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?	I went out on the boat.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!	It isn't true.  You have to believe me.

Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.	Doesn't matter. Move on.

Oh, just a old letter from a friend.	No treasure maps, huh?
Bar across the street.	Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?	I bet mom could've helped her.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.	Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Well, I'd like to read them.	No. We're going to lock this up and --
Don't say that!	Well, what am I supposed to think?
I thought everything WAS arranged.	Well, there's a problem.
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?	He's not coming.
"My niece had ""the changes"" when she was thirty-one."	No. What a tragedy. What happened?
"What do you know about ""the changes""?"	Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
They got heat in Michigan.	Not this kind of heat.
Not this kind of heat.	Heat is heat.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.	TO HELL WITH YOU!
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.	No one's asking you to!
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!	WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
Long day. Go to sleep.	Am I too heavy for you?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?	I had a temper.
I had a temper.	What were your parents like?
But you don't mind.	No, I don't mind.
I bet you could do a book.	No. I couldn't.
No. I couldn't.	Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?	Because I already tried once.
Nobody's asking you to.	And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!	I sat outside and had coffee.
Oh, I'm sorry.	It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
You want to eat something?	Are you hungry?
Would you like a beer for your bath?	Yes, that'd be nice.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.	Oh, how is he?
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.	The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.	I think he's running for town crier next year.

The light was fading. Huh-huh.	I would love to come for dinner.
Oh, sure. Great.	I'll pick you up.
Okay. See you later.	Yeah. See you later.
My mistake. I apologize.	What made you ask such a question?
What made you ask such a question?	I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Do you ever regret not having a family?	Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I told you, I love other people.	But no one in particular.
But no one in particular.	No. But I love them just the same.
No. But I love them just the same.	But it's not the same.
Woman friends, too?	I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
Smells like dirt.	You get used to it.
You want to go back in?	No. I'm all right. It's working.
Why did you stop?	My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.	Do you miss it?
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.	Why, do you think?
She starts sniffing me.	Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.	It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.	Then what happened?
Then what happened?	We got engaged.
Is the dizziness gone?	I think so.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.	I doubt that.
Oh. How old?	About a year and a half.
About a year and a half.	No, your kids.
No, your kids.	Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.	Must be nice having kids.
Mind if I smoke?	Not at all.
Oh, that's nice.	Want another cigarette?
Oh there you are.	Oh! You caught me.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?	Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Oh. When did you move back?	After the divorce.
How long you been married?	Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Maybe it's because I live here.	That must be it. It's a great smell.
Yes. And I've accepted.	What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
Want anything special for dinner?	Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
I'm going to miss you.	It's only four days.
What time is it?	Later. Go back to sleep.
Later. Go back to sleep.	Where you going?
Where you going?	I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.	Now?!  It's after eleven.
Now?!  It's after eleven.	I can't sleep.
I can't sleep.	Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.	Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
You feeling better Franny?	Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.	Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
About an hour ago.	They're not going to find her!
They're not going to find her!	Yes, they are.
When did she decide this?	Apparently just before her death.
Apparently just before her death.	Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
Don't feed that dog.	You people really don't like dogs.
Is it true?	Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.	Died there?  How?
Died there?  How?	How the hell should I know?
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?	He yours, sir?
You think that's really him?	Damn.  It's so...fresh.
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.	Just some flies.
Is this Hell?	Or just Hell-adjacent...
We can climb out.	Climb out to where?
Climb out to where?	Anywhere but here.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.	Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Where's the gangsta of love?	Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Where's the others?	Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.	Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.	I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Just try it.	I said, no thanks.
I said, no thanks.	Go on.  It won't kill you.
You got a nice crib here.	I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.	But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
Where are we, baby?	Where we'll always be...
You know I can't.	Then fuck it!!!
What it will be.	How did you get in here?
Sorry, my brother.	Since we was just grasshoppers...
Since we was just grasshoppers...	You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
It's alright, baby.	Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.	If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.	Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?	Your father.  He was your father.
All the more reason I should be here.	Please.  It's for your own good.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.	Have you ever been inside?
And what's that?	Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
Aren't you going to join us?	I have to finish this for class.
I can't.  Not yet.	It's alright.  If you want to go home...
Careful.  That's bad luck.	That place is already bad luck.
The dead get out?	Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.	And you believe her?
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.	Anytime.  Be seeing you.
Are they on the radio?	Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.	How do you know?
How do you know?	I manage them.
Let me see it.	Let me see it.
Let me see it.	Where is it?
You got the cash?	You got the shit?
We're here.  Where the hell are you?	Back here.  At the end of the block.
What are we doing down here?	Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Nice rack.  How old is --	That's it.  Get out.  Now!
I didn't sell it.	Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
What the hell do you want?	Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.	Don't call me that.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?	It was just like in my head.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?	The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.	Why not?  He eats everything else.
The next one blows off your dick.	You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!	Where is it?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?	I think you're fucking crazy!
I think you're fucking crazy!	Where is it?
How the fuck can I open it?	The same way you did before.
The same way you did before.	What are you talking about?
Open the case!	All right!  Where's the key?
All right!  Where's the key?	You don't need a key.
Where is this going, Johnnie?	Just admit it, Caesar.
So Caesar, what did it total out at?	Two point one seventy-six.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?	I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
You shouldn't have hit me.	You want to get into this now?
You want to get into this now?	No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.	You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!	Here, put this in his mouth.
Gimme the gun.	I can't.  I can't.
I can't.  I can't.	Give it to me.
Sit down, Gino!	No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Caesar?  What is this?	Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
We know how this was done, eh?	Yeah, I know.
Now that's teamwork.	I should have let him kill you.
I should have let him kill you.	You know he would have done you, too.
You know he would have done you, too.	I knew I couldn't trust you.
We were in a car accident --	They were in a car accident.
They were in a car accident.	But everybody is all right.
But everybody is all right.	They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
You betrayed me!	You murdered Gino!
You murdered Gino!	I had to.  You made me.
What did she do to you?	Everything you couldn't.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --	Don't try to tell me what to do.
Don't try to tell me what to do.	You need the money just like we do.
You need the money just like we do.	Shut up, Violet.
Shut up, Violet.	Let us go and we'll make a deal.
Where is the money?	Don't tell him --
Don't tell him --	Shut up, Violet!
Shut up, Violet!	He can't kill you --
What are you doing?	We're going to need some time.
We're going to need some time.	Who are you going to call?
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!	Caesar, someone could see us out here.
...  maybe three hours.	Caesar, what are you going to do?
Tell them!  Tell them!	For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
You can't leave.	The hell I can't!
The hell I can't!	I need you ...
Got to think this through ...	Caesar, maybe we should run --
It couldn't have been.	It was him.  I'm positive.
You mean they weren't up here?	No!  They're still on their way.
No!  They're still on their way.	That doesn't make any sense.
They were early.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	They just left, didn't they?
They just left, didn't they?	What are you, drunk?
Don't worry, I'll get some more.	There's no time.
There's no time.	Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?	Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.	What are you going to do with it?
Caesar, what happened?	It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
Not bad.  What for?	That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Oh, shit ...	Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
I didn't expect --	What the fuck is going on?
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.	All part of the business.
All part of the business.	All part of the business.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?	Go right ahead, sir.
How's it going tonight, fellas?	Pretty good, sir.
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.	I should be going.
I should be going.	What?  How about a drink?
You're helping Rajeev?	No.  Rajeev's in India.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?	Where's the fucking money?
Call me as soon as you get him.	Leave your phone on the hook.
You got the key?	Oh yeah.  Violet!
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.	Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
It's Gino!  It's Gino!	Where in the hell is he?
Is that the money?	Yeah, that's it.
We was worried about you, Cease.	Me?  Why?
No, Cease.  There was no answer.	I thought I heard someone knocking.
Okay, sure, Mick.	Caesar, you still got the money?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?	Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?	Are you okay, Violet?
This is a beautiful place.	...  thank you.
See?  We're for real.	I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.	You did the right thing.
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.	How do I know you are cops?
How'd it go?	I'm here, aren't I?
I'm sorry, Corky ...	Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Oh, thank God.	I'm still here.
I'm still here.	I was so afraid you ...
What if he doesn't run?	That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.	Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
okay, all right.	We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
He'll have to run.	If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.	You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
I'm just asking, what if?	If he does ...
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.	Trust me, Violet.
Where will you be?	Waiting in the apartment next door.
Does Johnnie hit on you?	Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.	Has Caesar ever seen him?
Has Caesar ever seen him?	He does it right in front of him.
He does it right in front of him.	It's getting better and better. Keep going.
That's his brother.	...  shit.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.	Like each other?  They hate each other.
It's in a case, on his desk.	Does the case lock?
And where is it now?	In his office.  I saw it this morning.
Then what?  Exactly.	He hung it up.
Do you think you know me like that?	I think ...
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --	How much money?
How much money?	Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.	I think so, too.
What about that guy this morning?	You mean Shelly?
You mean Shelly?	Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
Shit, here we go.	You didn't want to see me, did you?
What are you afraid of?	I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm not afraid of anything.	I don't understand - ?
We're not that different, Corky.	How can you sit in that bed and say that?
How can you sit in that bed and say that?	Because it's the truth.
What you heard wasn't sex.	What the fuck was it?
I guess I wanted to.	I'm glad you did.
I'm glad you did.	So am I.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?	You have to ask?
How long have you been with him?	Almost five years.
Almost five years.	Five years is a long time.
Five years is a long time.	Yes, it is.
...  I needed that.	Tell me about it.
I had to see you.	Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.	I wanted to apologize.
Okay, one drink.	What do you want?
He said you lost something.	Yeah, come on in.
Caesar is your husband?	Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
I knew it.	So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?	I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.	You're doing everything yourself?
So this is temporary for you?	Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?	Hey, Johnnie ...
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?	I think everything is okay.
-- he went inside! --	-- if we can get a clean shot --

I don't think so.	We have to go home, Jason.
We have to go home, Jason.	Jason Bourne is dead.
Jason...  They can't let you go...	That'll be their second worst mistake.
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?	I don't know.

I trusted you.	You're wrong.  I didn't know.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.	I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!	I didn't know this would happen.
But the police --	-- there's no time --

Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...	That's it?  Is that it?
You ever think maybe you have a family?	I thought about it.  I don't know.
I needed a break.	Where are we?
Where are we?	We're about an hour away.
We're about an hour away.	I can't believe I slept.

I don't know.	What does that mean?
What does that mean?	Listen to what you want.
Listen to what you want.	Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?

Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.	What do you want to break?
What do you want to break?	I don't know--let's break some windows.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.	Let me think.

No.  Don't worry about it.	I'll put her on.
You were smokin' toward the end there.	The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.

I don't like being handled.	Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.	Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.	What's wrong with it?
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.	Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
Shut up a second...	Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
And the rule was...	Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Never to pretend to know more than I did.	Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?

People phoned in.	Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.	I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding.	There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
I didn't know you were going with him.	Did you bring your grey suit?
Did you bring your grey suit?	Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
I write for you sometimes.	Not because you have to.
Okay.  Great line at the end.	Did you shoot their boots?
We can cut back at the end.	To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Eleven and a half.	Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
This conversation is not worthy of you.	I'd give anything if that were true.
He must have been great-looking, right?	Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?	Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
A half hour in the lobby.	Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
Your hair's a little funny.	It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
The cost-efficient reporter.	So I quit.
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...	Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.	Upper management thinks you're dull.

What is she shooting?	Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'	Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.	I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
What did he say?	I'll never tell.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.	Yes, there is.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.	I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
Do you want him all the way to the car?	No stop where he's all besieged.
Play back the last line...	He said something about...
He said something about...	Let me hear it!
Nobody else had it.	I wish it were you giving the story.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.	I see the change in you -- I see it.
They're not really going to call security are they?	No, I don't think so.
No, I don't think so.	How do I get out of here?
Ernie, they're calling from work.	Tell me I'm on the way in.
You don't have to finish tonight.	Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
No.  Not even you.	Why so glum?
Why so glum?	I don't know.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.	Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
I had no idea she was this good.	Fill for a second.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.	It's not opinion.
It's not opinion.	You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?	You want to come?
Then you should stay here.	It's better when you let me say it.
No.  Did he really?	Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
Hi, again.  Sorry about...	No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.	I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Hi.  It's me.	Where are you?
Where are you?	I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Because you're nuts.	Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
At least kiss me when you do that.	You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?	This is hysterical.
Why, you need me for the story?	No.  Were you going to you?
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?	Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.	I'll be the judge of that.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.	Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
What do you mean clean?	At work there's always this sort of film over you.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.	Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.	You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
I've got another story.	Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
How's it going?	Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Hi.  I was worried I was early.	I was a lot earlier.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.	Right back to you.
This is very awkward.	Go ahead -- what?
You're saying stay away from him.	I can't be.
Where's the bathroom?	Through the closet.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?	Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Are you okay?	Yes, I'm sorry.
Yes, I'm sorry.	Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?	The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Look -  This pose is all wrong!	I'll pose any way you want.
A girl with a body like mine?	You're breaking my concentration!
Not even a little bit?	I already told you I'm not.
That doesn't look like very much clay.	Oh it's enough...
Oh it's enough...	Are you nervous, Walter?
I'm almost ready -	Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?	Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
If you were an artist you could have created something!	I'm going home!
Would you like to do me?	I just might.
I just might.	I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
What the hell's going on?	Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.	What did he do?
What did he do?	He made a cat.
Walter...stay away from me!	Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Just about anything, Walter.	Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?	Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
You think I'm creative?	Of course I do!
Of course I do!	That means you like me!
Are you ready?	Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.	I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
I know what it is to be ignored.	Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
May I please have another little kiss?	Walter!  Jeez!
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!	Now you're a professional!
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?	It wasn't easy.
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.	Yeah it was all just an accident.
Great!  What is it?	It's a...full length life-size figure!
It's a...full length life-size figure!	What's it called?
You really like it?	Of course...it's wonderful.
Don't worry about him...what have you got?	A thing I made.
Walter...I can't believe it.	I'm honored to know this man.
Put it in the middle of the room!	When did you make this, Walter?
Here you go, enjoy.	I hope this was made with egg whites!
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.	Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
That's word for word.	Is it?  I've forgotten.
Would you pose for me for free?	Well, it all depends, Leonard...
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?	You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.	I admit it.
What's the matter with you?	Nothing...nothing at all.
Are you alright?	Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Are you trying to be funny?	I'm totally serious!
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!	Yeah, right outside the door!
What did he say?	Didn't you hear him?
Didn't you hear him?	No man I'm on my own plane.

It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.	I do the research.
What do you have in the box?	Just wait till you see this!
You might talk too much.	Yeah and what would I say?
It's hot in here...	You want me to open a window or something?
You know what that proves?	What, Mr. De Santis?
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...	Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
H-have a seat?	Have a seat -
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!	Good night Walter.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.	I don't have another cat!
People seem to like my cat.	Enough already about it - get to work!
Well...why did you put a knife in it?	I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to.	Got carried away, huh?
Where'd ya buy that?	I didn't buy it I made it.

Take it easy, though.	All right, all right. But I - I -
All right, all right. But I - I -	You'll get a heart attack like that.
Oh, sorry -	What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?	Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.	Since when do you talk like that?
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...	Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
The crowd bought it.	Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.	Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
Hmm. Not bad.	You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.	Uh Brock, today you are without me...
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.	No it's not.
"I'll bet the butler's name wasn't ""Jeff."""	You're probably right.
You say that like an amnesia victim.	Guilty. I am.
Guilty. I am.	Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.	I don't know. I can't remember.
Selina, are you okay?	Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...	Selina Kyle...lovely person.
Selina Kyle...lovely person.	She has a real spirit.
She has a real spirit.	A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?	She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?	I suppose she does.
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.	Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Yeah, this is better than rape.	Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.	Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
"""Dat's gotta hurt!"""	He didn't remember to roll up his window...
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...	Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
What did you say?	Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.	Why am I still troubled...
"What a ""drag."""	"""Well done,"" Cactus."
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.	Now he'll be up all night...
I still have one left...	You think so?...Selina?
You think so?...Selina?	You've seen me...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.	Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.

But of course you are.	I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...	I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
I don't know if I can do it alone.	Trust me, you won't have to.
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...	"What kind of name is ""Brock Leviathan?"""
I don't see anybody in there but you.	I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Was someone in an accident?	Do I hear a woman's voice?
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.	That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.	Then whose is it?
Then whose is it?	You gotta just look the other way.
Will you two cut it out?	This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
Theo wants to talk again.	Did you have to tell her my name?
What was that for?	You could've made me lose my call.
I didn't hurt you.	You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
Who's on the phone?	I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
Are you guys all right?	You could've killed us.
Can you make him stop!	Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
Let's have your license, mister.	I'm going to level with you officer.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?	Why would I do that?
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.	What do you keep making me out to be?
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.	Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.	If you know that just back off.
If you know that just back off.	Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.	And stop with the directions.
And stop with the directions.	"Make a ""U"" and go back."
You switched license plates?	It's taken care of.
Lose the hardware now.	We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.	What am I supposed to do?
I thought you said you could handle him.	I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...	I don't want it.
You won't live to see it.	It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.	Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
Know what else is in here?	Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
That's not good enough.	That's how it's going to be.
That's a reasonable possibility.	He might've heard everything we said in the car.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.	What's your point?
What's your point?	We can't leave him to repeat anything.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.	Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?	You're the man with the gun.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.	Only one way to find out.
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.	Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.	"How about ""later?"""
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.	That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.	Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.	You could've hit me.
A typical fuck-up.	What's that supposed to me?
You were at the Emerald that night?	Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.	I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
"Why pick me to be your ""mark?"""	Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.	You knew about me.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.	There isn't any such person.
There isn't any such person.	Whose money is this?
The guy with the transplant.	Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?	Damned if I know.
At least one.	Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.	You timed that beautifully.
You timed that beautifully.	They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
I thought it was inspired.	There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
He had a gun.  I have it now.	Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Now I have -- it's a long story.	Why didn't you just shoot them?
So far they're keeping their part of it.	They put their hands all over me.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.	Include me in that.
Rachel -- Oh my God.	Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
I can't do it.	Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
Can you walk?	Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.	Are you okay?
Are you okay?	They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.	That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Lucky for them they didn't.	What did you do?
Did you hear that click?	Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?	Or somebody else there is listening in --
To hide it from the I.R.S.	How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?	Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Don't talk.  Don't talk!	What's going on?

Why tell me this?	Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.	You can't give up.
Not a chance.	Don't say that.
Don't say that.	Do you know what's in that box?
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Black Mercedes, 600S.
She's gone --	Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!	I'm trying to.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?	That's not her.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.	I can hear you again, clearly.
That makes two of us.	You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
What do you do for a living?	Sometimes I paint.
Sometimes I paint.	Our house always needs touching up.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.	They say my work is somewhat derivative.
How much time do you have left on it?	I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Hey drop it, okay?	I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.	What about the others?
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.	Tell me what she looks like.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?	26th off Wilshire.
The cops could trace this call back to you.	One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.	What makes you say that?
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?	No -- nothing.
Who smashed the phone?	They're holding my husband downstairs.
I don't believe you.	You're the one who's not to be believed.
You're the one who's not to be believed.	My name is --
My name is --	I don't want to know --
I don't want to know --	My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.	Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.	I realize you don't want to be involved.
You won't disconnect.	Oh won't I?
Oh won't I?	Because you know you'll be killing us.
Because you know you'll be killing us.	Don't lay this on me!
Don't lay this on me!	Then hang up!  Do it!
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --	You don't understand.
Will you let me explain!	And what're you whispering for?
And what're you whispering for?	I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.	Who is this?
Who is this?	You mustn't hang up.
Seems like it.	Put the girl on.
Stop the crying.	She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?	I'm backing up.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.	And not a nickel.
I don't know what you mean.	I still don't see you.
I'm here.  Where are you?	We don't see you.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.	You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.	I wish it had never been invented.
Where do we meet?	It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
They saw you kill the driver.	You're up on your details, aren't you?
Who were you talking to?	Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.	Stay put!  I know my way around.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.	We're gonna get there first.
We're gonna get there first.	How do you know?
How do you know?	Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.	Take the 405 south.
I can see the benefit in that.	You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
I thought you'd know me by now.	What does it take to kill you?
What does it take to kill you?	I suppose you're in your taxi?
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?	My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
Who am I talking to?	"Call me ""Nels."""
What's he doing?  Answer me!	Better reassure him.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?	Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.	Mind if I have a look?
Who are you?	Let me talk to the lady again.
Let me talk to the lady again.	There's no lady here.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.	From here on, I dish it out.
I already called for an ambulance.	You've got a <u>phone</u>?
She's not a girl, Col --	Whatever you say.
It takes all types.	So who's he?
So who's he?	He's what she should run a mile from.
He's what she should run a mile from.	Then why doesn't she?
Then why doesn't she?	Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?	Is that good or bad?
You see that, Col?	Saw it, Dil.
Saw it, Dil.	Fuck it, is what I say.
Fuck it, is what I say.	Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.	Fucking men, Col --
Stop it, Dil --	No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Good thing in a man.	An excellent quality.
An excellent quality.	Maybe he wants something.
Maybe he wants something.	I would expect he does.
He agreed that he was.	What do you think his name is?
What do you think his name is?	I've no thoughts on the subject.
Saw that one.	What would you call it?
What would you call it?	Now, that was a look.
See that, Col?	See what, Dil?
See what, Dil?	He gave me a look.
Look, I'm sorry.	Fuck off, Dave.
Don't chuck my clothes out!	Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Take your clothes.	Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Don't throw my clothes out the window!	Fuck off back to Essex!
Sure, Dave --	Please, Dil --
Don't be like that --	You heard me --
Fuck off, Dave.	C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
What's that supposed to mean?	It's a simple question.
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?	She's not a tart.
She's not a tart.	No, of course not, she's a lady.
No, of course not, she's a lady.	She's not that either.
Do you mean that?	He wants to know do I mean that.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.	Bloody right I do...
Not in my experience.	Off his wages.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?	Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.	Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --	Stop it, Dil --
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -	Please, Dil --
As the man said, it's in my nature.	What's that supposed to mean?
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --	Don't call me that --
Meet Col --	Yes. Say hello to Col --
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?	Not if you go.
Not if you go.	Will I see you again?

It's my name, Dil --	What happened to Jimmy?
Say it again.	I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Tell me you love me.	Whatever you say, Dil.
Whatever you say, Dil.	Then say it.
Then say it.	Love you, Dil.
You like me now, Jimmy?	I like you, Dil --
I like you, Dil --	Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
Got to be somewhere.	Try and go, then.
You killed my Jody?	In a manner of speaking.
In a manner of speaking.	It was you...
You knew my Jody?	Are you listening?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.	You knew which man?
Are you all right, Dil?	I will be.
Are you supposed to take that many?	Only in times of extreme stress.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.	You mean that?
So tell me.	I was trying to get out of something.
I was trying to get out of something.	No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?	I'm going home!
I'm going home!	Told you to stay in the hotel!
Told you to stay in the hotel!	Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
Why are we going here, Jimmy?	Look on it like a honeymoon.
Don't call me that --	Sorry. What you doing?
It's a secret.	You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
You said anything, Dil	A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --	Want to change you to a man, Dil...
You want another haircut, baby?	No. Sit down.
What you doing, Jimmy?	I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.	Do you like me even a little bit?
Do you like me even a little bit?	More than that.
She from Scotland too?	You could say that.
You could say that.	And you're not going to tell me more?
Shouldn't be, Dil	Why shouldn't I be jealous?
Dil, this is Jude.	You following me?
He'd bring me carnations.	So I got it wrong, then.
So I got it wrong, then.	Not at all, honey.
No. Can't pretend that much.	I miss you, Jimmy.
I miss you, Jimmy.	Should have stayed a girl.
Should have stayed a girl.	Don't be cruel.
Don't be cruel.	Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.	Only if you kiss me.
There's Dave. He knew too.	Stop it, Jimmy.
Kind of wish I didn't.	You can always pretend.
You can always pretend.	That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Won't be quite the same though, will it?	Are you pretending yet?
Are you pretending yet?	I'm working on it.
Details, baby, details.	So they do know.
So they do know.	All right, they do.
Do they know?	Know what, honey?
Know what, honey?	Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.	Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.	Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
Kind of liked you as a girl.	That's a start.
That's a start.	So I'm sorry.
So I'm sorry.	Make it up to me, then.
Ask to meet me again.	Will you meet me again?
I didn't mean to hit you.	I know that.
Made me feel all funny inside.	I said stop it.
I said stop it.	Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.	You think that's wise?
Do you care, Jimmy?	Sure I do.
Sure I do.	You mean that?
You mean that?	Yeah. I care, Dil.
You're something else, Dil, you know that?	Never said a truer word.
What you doing here?	Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.	Don't call me that.
Give it over, Dil --	Apologies, my sweet.
Tell him it hurt --	I have to talk to her, Col --
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?	All the time.
What you thinking of, hon?	I'm thinking of your man.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.	Told you, I'm superstitious.
The thing is, can you go the distance?	Depends what it is.
Depends what it is.	No, depends on nothing.
What is this?	I'm superstitious. Drink.
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?	Want to look after you.
Want to look after you.	What does that mean?
What does that mean?	Something I heard someone say once.
Did he come here too?	Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.	Did he dance with you?
But you can t stay, you know that?	Didn't think I could.
Didn't think I could.	A real gentleman...
Do you miss him?	What do you think?
What do you think?	I think you do.
I think you do.	You say that like a gentleman.
As different as it's possible to be.	Tell me about him.
He lived here with you?	Tried to. Sit down, will you?
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?	Must be in love to manage that.
Must be in love to manage that.	Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Someone out there.	Jesus fucking Christ.
You want me to ask you in, right?	No, I didn't --
He's getting up.	You can't leave me then, can you?
You all right?	Yes, thank you.
Yes, thank you.	What was that all about?
What was that all about?	He wants me to perform for him.
You on the game?	God no. I'm a hairdresser.
What was that?	They all get the wrong idea.
Tell her I'm very happy with it.	He's Scottish, Col.
How'd you guess?	The accent, I suppose.
The accent, I suppose.	And what's it like?
Doesn't the water get to your nails?	What's it to you?
Someone recommend you?	In a way.
Guy I work with.	What's his name?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.	Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.	A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?	A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?	Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?	That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
What was it?	You know her, Jimmy?
You know her, Jimmy?	Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
So what do you need, Fergus?	Need to go across the water.
Need to go across the water.	Do you now.
Do you now.	Need to lose myself awhile.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.	That's wise, Tommy.
That's wise, Tommy.	All right, then. I like to be wise.
You a handyman, Fergie?	I take pride in my work.
I take pride in my work.	I sincerely hope so.
And what if you don't?	Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.	You may be right.
And what if I say no?	You know what. Go.
And then you'll leave her out of it?	Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
But, then, I don't have a choice.	Och, you do, Fergie.
Och, you do, Fergie.	Of course. I forgot.
Of course. I forgot.	Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?	No, what is the thing?
No way, Jude. I'm out.	You're never out, Fergus.
Tough work, that.	Someone's got to do it.
You don't know that.	Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Did you give him it?	There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.	Have a look at him.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.	He's all right.
He's all right.	Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
See does he want some.	Do you want some food?
Thank God for that.	You being cynical, Hennessy?
And who is she?	Just a girl.
So it was you all the time.	Who'd you think it was?
Who'd you think it was?	I thought it was Dave.
I thought it was Dave.	And who's Dave when he's at home?
And who's Dave when he's at home?	He's at home.
He's at home.	Should blow you away, you know that?
Should blow you away, you know that?	I know that.
Why do you want to do that for?	Would make me feel better about it.
Would make me feel better about it.	You sure about that?
You OK about that?	I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
So he knows your name?	I told him.
I told him.	Are you all there?
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.	Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.	Why would you do that?
Why would you do that?	The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
Give him a cup of tea.	Do you want a cup of tea?
You stupid bastard --	What you say, faster?
What you say, faster?	I said you bastard -- stop --
I said you bastard -- stop --	Got to catch me first --
Stop that talk now --	Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Faster than cricket?	Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?	Me? No, I'm not good for much...
Go to sleep now.	I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Like the one about the frog?	And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.	When I was a child...
How can I?	I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.	I told you not to talk that way --
See if she's all right.	I don't know her.
I don't know her.	Take her picture. C'mere.
She can't help it.	Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.	You liked her?
Don't know her.	Want you to do something, Fergus.
If they kill me --	Don't think that way.
Is it bad?	No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
We don't look on it like that.	I've often wondered how you do it.
I've often wondered how you do it.	Depends on what you believe in.
Depends on what you believe in.	What do you believe in?
What do you believe in?	That you guys shouldn't be here.
That you guys shouldn't be here.	It's as simple as that?
Where would you most like to be now, man?	Doesn't matter where.
Doesn't matter where.	Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.	Having a pint in the Rock.
Having a pint in the Rock.	You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
See? I was right about you.	Don't be so sure.
Don't be so sure.	Jody's always right.
Shut up, would you?	I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Now put it back in.	Give us a break.
Now, that was worth waiting for.	Hurry up, would you?
Hurry up, would you?	These things take time, Fergus.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.	My pleasure, Jody
What the fuck am I doing here.	What the fuck were you doing here?
What the fuck were you doing here?	I got sent.
I got sent.	You could have said no.
You could have said no.	Can't. Once I signed up.
Can't. Once I signed up.	Why did you sign up?
And you play cricket?.	Best game in the world.
Best game in the world.	Ever see hurling?
You make a nice couple.	Don't I know it.
Don't I know it.	So what were you fucking around for, then?
So what were you fucking around for, then?	You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --	She's a friend of mine
She'd be anyone's type.	Don't you think of it, fucker.
She your wife?	Suppose you could say that.
Didn't look like that to me...	She's not my type.
They won't let him die.	You want to bet?
You want to bet?	I'm not a gambling man.
Why can't we?	Not in your nature.
Not in your nature.	What do you know about my nature?
What do you know about my nature?	I'm talking about your people, not you.
I'm talking about your people, not you.	What the fuck do you know about my people?
Shut the fuck up, would you?	And you know the funny thing?
And you know the funny thing?	No, what's the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?	I didn't even fancy her.
What is it now?	You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Nope. Not handsome at all.	You trying to hurt my feelings?
You trying to hurt my feelings?	No. It's the truth.
No. It's the truth.	Well, I could say the same about you.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.	So I've noticed.
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.	Can't we take it off?
How did you know it was her?	I can smell her perfume.
This is a farce, man.	How is it a farce?
How is it a farce?	I seen your fucking face.
I seen your fucking face.	So, what do I look like?
What do you mean you can't?	Can't eat through a canvas bag.
I said shut the fuck up --	He believes in the future --
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --	He's a good soldier, Jude.
Have you no feelings, woman?	You shut your face --
Thought you liked me, bitch.	It was fun while it lasted.
Come and get me, soldier --	Whatever you say, Jude...
I never know nothing.	People. They could be looking.
Who gives a fuck.	You never know.
And you know what?	Tell me, Jody
What if I did?	You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Don't run off, Jude.	You don't know me, do you?
Give me the shooter, Jude --	You're crazy --
You're crazy --	Give me the fucking shooter!
That fucker's dead --	No, we are.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.	That true, Fergus? You in love?
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.	Shut the fuck up, Jude.
All right -- where's the letter?	The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
I said, tell me to go to the --	I heard you, I heard you.
I heard you, I heard you.	Then say it.
Then say it.	Reggie -- listen to me --
Reggie -- listen to me --	Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
You didn't have to chase me so hard --	Here, give it to me.
Reggie -- listen to me!	You lied to me so many times --
You lied to me so many times --	Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.	Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?	There's not a reason on earth why you should.
But I didn't kill anybody.	Then who did? You're the only one left.
Reggie -- why won't you listen?	I'm through listening to you!
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!	But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !	Don't be an idiot!
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.	Tex? You mean he's here, too?
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --	I know, but this is all we've got left.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.	Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
I love you, Adam.	Yes, you told me.
Yes, you told me.	"No -- last time I said ""I love you, Alex."""
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.	The letter --
Let's look anyway.	Lord, you're stubborn.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --	Where's that airlines bag?
Where's that airlines bag?	Lord, you're stubborn.
Lord, you're stubborn.	I sure am. Get it.
When you come on, you really come on.	Well -- come on.
You don't look so bad in this light.	Why do you think I brought you here?
What's the matter?	I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Oh, you should see your face.	What about it?
I could eat a horse.	I think that's what you ordered.
No -- I guess not.	It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?	Yes, but --
Are you sure there's no mistake?	None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
That's the spirit.	Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.	No, Mrs. Lampert.
No, Mrs. Lampert.	But no one actually saw him die.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?	Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?	Were you followed?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.	What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?	He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
I believe you.	Thanks very much.
Oh, I see.	And I'm afraid we want it back.
And I'm afraid we want it back.	But I don't have it.
But I don't have it.	That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.	I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.	So that was it.
So that was it.	Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.	His -- real -- ?
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?	I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?	Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.	You mean spies and things like that?
You mean spies and things like that?	Only we call them agents.
Only we call them agents.	We? You mean you're --?
We? You mean you're --?	Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?	Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.	May I have a sandwich, please?
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.	Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?	No, thank heaven.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?	1944. The next face, please.
Starting with his own.	Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.	What's your first name today?
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?	Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
You'd lie about anything.	Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.	I'll take that.
Then who does?	I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Sorry about that.	Okay -- up there.
How long do you intend -- ?	I said with the mouth shut.
Fiction or non-fiction?	Why don't you shut up!
I don't believe it.	Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.	I don't believe it.
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.	How often do you go through this little ritual?
Shut the door!	I don't think I know that one.
Then I suggest you call one of them.	I dare you.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?	Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.	I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
They've got Jean-Louis!	That sounds like their problem.
That sounds like their problem.	I'll be right there.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.	I think I love you, Alex --
What are you doing?	Cutting it out.
Cutting it out.	Who told you to do that?
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.	I'm not fifteen.
Why can't you be serious?	There, you said it.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?	Because he's wearing moccasins.
Because he's wearing moccasins.	Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.	Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Why not a lying Blackfoot?	Which one are you?
Which one are you?	Whitefoot, of course.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?	Would you like to see my passport?
Would you like to see my passport?	Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?	Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?	Yes, but we're divorced.
Yes, but we're divorced.	I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.	I'm no easier to live with than he was.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.	There -- you're a new man.
Does it hurt?	Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
I left him hanging around the American Express.	Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.	Carson Dyle is dead.
Carson Dyle is dead.	Yes, he is. He was my brother.
How much is it worth?	The money is unimportant.
The money is unimportant.	I'm afraid it is important.
I'm afraid it is important.	In your money, perhaps $65,000.
What's its value today?	In human life? In greed? In suffering?
Monsieur Flix -- ?	I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
What do you mean, no?	The kid said --
Not unless we're blind.	You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.	Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.	Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
You sure nuthin's missin'?	No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?	And if it is?
And if it is?	Why bother him?
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.	But his mother --
Mrs. Lampert --	What do you want?
What do you want?	Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?	Tell me what?
I don't know anything.	Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.	Leave me alone -- !
I was, too.	In Mr. Dyle's room?
In Mr. Dyle's room?	No -- in my room.
I don't understand.	And this? And this?
Is that all? Can I go now?	One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
Is it all right?	I wish you wouldn't.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?	He didn't have one.
He didn't have one.	He was a wealthy man?
He was a wealthy man?	I don't know. I suppose so.
I don't know. I suppose so.	About how wealthy would you say?
About how wealthy would you say?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Where did he keep his money?
Where did he keep his money?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?	I don't know.
I don't know.	C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!	I know.  I'm sorry.
I know.  I'm sorry.	It is all right.
You loved him?	I'm very cold.
I found it! I found it!	If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.	We won! We won!
I know. I would bury it in the garden.	Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.	Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
I wouldn't take that too seriously.	I believe what he said.
I believe what he said.	They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.	How do you know what they're doing?
Words can hurt very much.	Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.	Don't put yourself out.
Don't put yourself out.	Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.	Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Yes -- that's right.	What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
Who is it?	The man you had the fight with.
Be careful, Peter.	You took the words right out of my mouth.
Peter -- are you all right?	I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
On the street where you live.	How about once more around the park?
How do you shave in there?	What was it?
What was it?	What was what?
What was what?	What your husband was mixed up in.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.	I wasn't --
What are you doing in here?	Having a nervous breakdown.
What was all that?	Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.	You mean you and me?
You mean you and me?	No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
What's going on?	Don't you understand French?
Don't you understand French?	I'm still having trouble with English.
I'm still having trouble with English.	The man and the woman are married --
Where did everything go?	Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.	Do you know what you're going to do?
Come on. You can't stay here.	I don't know where to go.
I don't know where to go.	We'll find you a hotel.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.	Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
How did you find out?	It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.	I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.	Sorry. Which view would you like?
I'm Regina Lampert.	Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Good for you.	No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.	Please, not on my account.
Please, not on my account.	No, you see, I don't really love him.
No, you see, I don't really love him.	Well, you're honest, anyway.
Oh. I guess.	Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?	Yes, but we're divorced.
Yes, but we're divorced.	That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.	Is your husband with you?
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.	Now you're angry.
Shakespeare never said that.	How do you know?
How do you know?	It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?	It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
Why, do you think we're going to?	I don't know -- how would I know?
Please stop -- please!	You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...	No -- no, I'm don't.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.	Wha -- what do you want?
I don't see him.	We will separate -- you look over there.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?	Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.	What's he up to?
What's the matter, chrie?	Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.	Oh la vache!
Who is it from?	The American Embassy.
Do you know him?	I've never seen him before.
I've never seen him before.	He must have known Charles pretty well.
He must have known Charles pretty well.	How can you tell?
How can you tell?	He's allergic to him.
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.	Didn't Charles have any friends?
He knows everything.	Don't you want me to stay?
But why do you want a divorce?	Because I don't love him.
Because I don't love him.	But that is no reason to get a divorce!
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.	a alors! From Charles?
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.	We want that money -- now!
Howdy, Miz Lampert.	Who invited you?
Yeah? What's that?	He took care of Charlie for us.
One more time.	I get the imports.
I get all your CDs.	Not my imports.
I never fucked Rod.	Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
You were eavesdropping.	No I wasn't.
No I wasn't.	What did you hear?
You know her?	It can't be.
It can't be.	Who is she Daddy?
It was a she.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
What do you mean?	Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?	Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.	I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
How much further?	Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!	I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.	Not much further.
Not much further.	You never went, uh, all the way?
I want you to head right home after school.	I will. Is that all?
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.	It won't happen again.
It won't happen again.	You said that two weeks ago.
It's almost ten o'clock.	Daddy you scared me!
Daddy you scared me!	You're grounded Friday night!
Should we close down any eruption?	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	We're seeing all the signs in town.
We need you here. I can bring her in.	No. I'll handle this.
What are you doing?	This will relax her.
She's still a virgin.	Did you warn her?
Is Jody still awake?	She just turned off her light.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?	No, you couldn't.
A bullet to the right cerebellum.	She was murdered?
She was murdered?	No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.	She's not here.
She's not here.	You know where I can find her?
But I shouldn't shut it down?	No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
You gave me a 'D'.	I'm sure you should have failed.
I'm sure you should have failed.	I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Pay no attention to me.	What are you doing here?
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?	You think you're my sister?
What do you know about my father?	He's a rapist. Like mine.
of COURSE. You're not scared?	Of course I'm scared.
Of course I'm scared.	Then you should go.
Then you should go.	You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?	I really do. For your own safety.

Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.	Where's the girl?
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.	Aren't you coming back with me?
Aren't you coming back with me?	Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.	...That's not what I meant.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?	I will if you don't.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.	What does it look like?
I am not!	Then let's go talk to her.
Just... I have to.	And I want to know where.
The Albacore Club.	It has to do with my father.
He owns it. You know?	I saw him.
I saw him.	You saw my fa... father? When?
You didn't tell me.	There hasn't been a lot of time.
What about it?	There's something black in the green part of your eye.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.	Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
Hold still. Why?	You can't always tell what's going on there.
You can't always tell what's going on there.	...No. Why was it.
As little as possible.	The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?	They do in Chinatown.
It was in Chinatown.	What were you doing there?
What were you doing there?	Working for the District Attorney.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.	When was the last time?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.	I gave everybody the night off.
I gave everybody the night off.	Easy, it's an innocent question.
Easy, it's an innocent question.	No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.	They can't be.
They can't be.	They may not know it but they are.
We got it. We got it, baby.	What? What is it?
Is that unusual?	Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.	Never forgave him for what?
You sure shout that?	Of course I'm sure.
Of course I'm sure.	What about you? Do you and your father get along?
Another satisfied client?	Another satisfied client's wife.
How did it happen?	Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.	Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?	More like other people putting their business in my nose.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.	No. I'm just a snoop.
No, not for that one.	I don't believe you.
Is there anything else you want to know?	Where you were when your husband died.
Where you were when your husband died.	I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.	You mean you don't know where you were?
You mean you don't know where you were?	I mean I can't tell you.
I mean I can't tell you.	You were seeing someone, too.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'	Did you have affairs?
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?	I was grateful.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.	Well, how much would you like?
I got your check in the mall.	Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.	...Just a minute...
...Just a minute...	You left your keys in the ignition.
You left your keys in the ignition.	Oh... thank you.
No. I went riding rather early.	Looks like you went quite a distance.
I'll stop by.	Please call first.
What do you mean?	May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?	You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?	Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Yes, Mr. Gittes?	I don't want to drop it.
Would you like something to drink?	What are you having?
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.	But, Mr. Gittes.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.	What'd you expect? That's his job.
I think I got something.	Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
The obituary column?	You'll find one of those people.
You'll find one of those people.	'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.	Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?	Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
Perhaps if we could meet your father.	There's just one question.
Oh my goodness.	Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?	I said, the northwest valley.
I said, the northwest valley.	That's like saying they're in Arizona.
I cut myself shaving.	You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.	Only when I breathe.
I never was.	I don't understand.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?	I'm sorry, I --
I'm sorry, I --	Well, tell him I'll be back.
And Mulwray isn't?	He never even kids about it.
He never even kids about it.	Maybe he takes it very seriously.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.	I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
Do you know me?	Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.	Have we ever met?
What about the water?	When it comes.
When it comes.	When it comes? What'd you tell him?
It's bone dry, Morty.	It's not completely dry.
The L.A. River?	Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.	That's a long fall.
That's a long fall.	So how are you, Morty?
Yeah?... I do?	Sure you do.
All right, what's your husband's first name?	Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.	Water and Power?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?	...Yes of course.
...Yes of course.	Then go home and forget about it.
Of course not.	Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
I'm afraid so.	I am sorry.
No problem with me on the Job.	Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.	Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.	They were partners.
They were partners.	Yes. Yes, they were partners.
He did or he didn't?	He owned it.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.	Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.	He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.	I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Mr. Mulwray, please.	He's not in, Mr.?
May I ask what this is regarding?	It's personal. Has he been out long?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.	He was expecting you?
He was expecting you?	Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
So he says you sent them?	They're all a bunch of phonies.
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?	Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Neither do I.	No, you have a press agent do it.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?	Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
Course, she settled down nicely.	Well, you never know, do you?
Well, you never know, do you?	That's for sure.
That's for sure.	Why'd she run away?
Why'd she run away?	Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.	We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
I'm working for his daughter.	That right?... She used to be some looker.
That right?... She used to be some looker.	She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.	She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.	You must be thinking of a different daughter.
Did you ever see her again?	No. And nobody knows where she is.
You weren't expecting me?	No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.	What's she like? What's she like?...
Now what can you see?	Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?	That's right, Modern Times.
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!	Progress! It always arrives too late!
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.	Why? What do you mean?
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso?	Come in, Alfredo.
Will they really find work in Germany?	Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal...
You understand which side the gelatin's on?	It tastes wonderful!
What are you doing here?	I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film.
You understand now? You see it clearly?	Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
My husband...you know him.	Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Father, I have sinned...	We'll talk about that later.
Hi. Why are you running?	No particular reason...  Nice day, huh?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh?	Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
My name's Salvatore...And yours?	Elena. My name's Elena.
Then where's the money?	Somebody stole it.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.	You don't really think so?
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.	Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -	I'll write it myself.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.	Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
I didn't see that.	It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.	I can't take shorthand.
I can't take shorthand.	Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
Mr. Kane -	That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.	Where is he?
That's fine, Mr. Kane.	I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -	How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
Yes, very!  Naturally.	Well, well - isn't that nice?
Go in and ask him to hurry.	Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.	I might make him nervous.
Who else you been to see?	Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
I'm going back there.	Who else did you see?
Mr. Kane is finishing it.	Kane?  Charlie?  Where is he?
Sixty-two thousand -	That looks pretty nice.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?	You've got a private office here, haven't you?
"Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the ""Enquirer."" I am Herbert Carter."	Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.	How do you do, Mr. Leland?
How do you do, Mr. Leland?	Are they standing for me?
It isn't finished?	No, Mr. Kane.
No, Mr. Kane.	That's Leland, isn't it?
That's Leland, isn't it?	Yes, Mr. Kane.
Yes, Mr. Kane.	Has he said when he'll finish?
Has he said when he'll finish?	We haven't heard from him.
We haven't heard from him.	He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
And the notice?	Yes - Mr. Kane.
Yes - Mr. Kane.	Is it good?
Is it good?	Yes, Mr. kane.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!	We've got a nice plant here.
What story, Mr. Rogers?	The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Almost two to one -	I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Oh yes, there is.	I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
It can wait.	No, it can't.  Good night, darling.
I won't let you go.	You can't stop me.
Susan, it seems to me -	Don't tell me you're sorry.
Don't tell me you're sorry.	I'm not sorry.
I'm not sorry.	I'm going to leave you.
I'm going to leave you.	No, you're not.
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?	Half past eleven.
Half past eleven.	I mean in New York.
I mean in New York.	Half past eleven.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.	Can't we go back, Charlie?
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.	Would you sing for me?
Would you sing for me?	Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.	Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.	Well, I -
Well, I -	Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?	Oh, no, that's all gone.
Oh, no, that's all gone.	Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Oh, me -	How old did you say you were?
How old did you say you were?	I didn't say.
I work at Seligman's.	Is that what you want to do?
Where's the towel?	On the chiffonier.  Here.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.	I know...  But you do look so silly.
Where's the soap?	In the water.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?	No.  They've passed on.
Get out, both of you!	Charlie, please don't -
Charlie, please don't -	What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -	I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -	Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
You goin', Mom?	Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -	Where'm I going?
Oh, yes, sir.	Do you know what that is?
Do you know what that is?	It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.	Persia.  It belonged to a king.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.	I didn't used to be afraid of it.
Yes, Mr. Kane.	Not my wife - not either of them.
Do you like poetry, Raymond?	Can't say, sir.
Can't say, sir.	Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
Is Mrs. Kane -	Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Are you finished?	Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
First of all -	What's wrong, Brad?
I've got to think of Emily -	I'd like to talk to you about that.
It's been a tough day.	A wasted day.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?	Mr. Leland sent back that check.
Oh, yes, the bonus.	It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.	It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
I'll sign those papers -	You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
Brief marriage!  Ten years!	Was he in love?
It's a letter from her lawyers.	David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston -
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston -	Rawlston is my boss.
Rawlston is my boss.	Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -	This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.	How do you do, Charles?
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?	Right here, Mrs. Kane.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?	Millions - if anybody wants it.
Millions - if anybody wants it.	The banks are out of luck, eh?
The banks are out of luck, eh?	Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
That's the whole works, right up to date.	Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?	Yes and no.
Yes and no.	Well, thanks a lot.
What did you get?	What do you mean?
How did you meet him?	I had a toothache.
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?	I'll have a highball.
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?	This? How long have you been smoking?
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.	I'll just take the gum.
It's not the same.	It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?	What the hell is that?
You're shittin' me.	You think I'm shitting you...
Are you sure?	Am I sure?
Am I sure?	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	Am I sure about what?
Am I sure about what?	Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?	Are you serious?
Are you serious?	How long have you been smoking?
How long have you been smoking?	What is this, a poll?
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.	No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Thanks. Have a good one.	Do you mind if I drink this here?
Do you mind if I drink this here?	Sure. Go ahead.
Nobody! I swear!	I feel nauseous.
I was here the whole time.	You two better quit it.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.	Territoriality. He was mine first.
Territoriality. He was mine first.	Awww. That was so cute.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.	Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
I take it she likes the guy.	You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
She said not to come home until graduation.	Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?	What can I say? He does weird things to me.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.	Can I watch?
Can I watch?	You can hold me down.
You can hold me down.	Can I join in?
Can I join in?	You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
So where is he?	He went home to change for the big date.
He went home to change for the big date.	God, isn't he great?
God, isn't he great?	No, this is great.
No, this is great.	Can I use the bathroom?
Can I use the bathroom?	There's no light back there.
There's no light back there.	Why aren't there any lights?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...	Call the police.
Stop this. This isn't funny.	I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.	This isn't fucking funny, Dante!

It wasn't me.	Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?	Was it you?
How'd you get here so fast?	I left like an hour ago.
I left like an hour ago.	Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
You saw it?	Very dramatic, I thought.
Very dramatic, I thought.	It's not what you think.
And you said yes?	Well... kind of, sort of?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.	Was I right?
Sang? His name is a past tense?	Stop it. He's a nice guy.
I just told you.	There's more, isn't there?
There's more, isn't there?	Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?	Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.	You don't have anything to do with it.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.	Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.	But can we date?
But can we date?	I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.	We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.	You're serious. You want to date again.

Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?	Train. It took eight hours.
Train. It took eight hours.	I can't believe you're here.
My God. I haven't seen you since...	Dante. You've got a customer.
Was he alive when... Caitlin...	No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
Then who operated the store?	Nobody. It was closed.
Nobody. It was closed.	With this guy locked in?
What time was this?	Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
Like you're better!	I can whip your ass.
Who are you to make assessments?	I'll assess all I want!
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!	In a second!
I can pass!	How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
Pack of cigarettes.	What's your point?
You only brought one ball?!	I thought Redding had like three balls!
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.	Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
Do you work tomorrow?	Same time. What about you?
Get the fuck outta here already.	I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
You need a ride?	Got one. Just pulled up.
You still didn't have to choke me.	Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.	Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?	Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.	No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
How do you figure?	What time did you get to work today?
What time did you get to work today?	Like ten after.
To talk to you.	Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.	It's not like I'm miles away.
It's not like I'm miles away.	Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.

Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.	What are you talking about?
It's the same thing with Veronica.	Leave her out of this.
Who're you kidding? You can so.	Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Why do I have this life?	Have some chips; you'll feel better.
Around three or something.	What time did we go to the funeral?
What time did we go to the funeral?	I think four.
You just fucked a total stranger?	Shut the fuck up!
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.	I don't; you did.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?	Holy shit. That girl?
Then how come you got the fine?	Because I'm here.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.	Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?	Because I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?	No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.	Now I know you're lying.
Now I know you're lying.	I'm not. She just left.
I'm not. She just left.	What did she say?
Wow. You've had quite an evening.	She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Watch the store while I go home and change.	What happened to title dictates behavior?
What happened to title dictates behavior?	This is my way of spitting water at life.
This is my way of spitting water at life.	Hey, what about Veronica?

Balls resting on his lips.	He made it, hunhh?
He made it, hunhh?	Yeah, but at what a price.
She was pretty young, hunhh?	Twenty-two; same as us.
Twenty-two; same as us.	An embolism in a pool.
An embolism in a pool.	An embarrassing way to die.
An embarrassing way to die.	That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.	How'd he die?
How'd he die?	Broke his neck.
Oh, my god.	Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
You've had sex with a dead person.	I'm gonna go to her wake.
I'm gonna go to her wake.	No, you're not.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.	Shit. What about tomorrow?
Shit. What about tomorrow?	One night only. She's buried in the morning.
You hate people.	But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
If you go, I go.	She meant nothing to you!
I'm not taking you to this funeral.	I'm going with you.
I'm going with you.	I can't close the store.

You take one more step, I'll kill her.	You'd do her a favor.
Mom, Vincent's not interested.	Oh, I'm captivated.
Show up for <u>what?</u>	She's in the hospital.
She's in the hospital.	You go every night?
You go every night?	What difference does it make?
Show up for what?	Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Max?  What are you doing?	Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.	Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.	<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
What you mean, no?	I'm done.  Find another cab.
Let him go, Vincent.	You mind?  I'm working here.
I'm...what?  Sorry?	Jazz.  Music.
Jazz.  Music.	I listen to classical.
I need the job.	No you don't.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.	Good luck.  You think they got families?
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!	I didn't throw him, he fell.
I didn't throw him, he fell.	What'd he do to you?
What'd he do to you?	Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.	How can you kill him like that?
Who was he?	What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?	Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...	I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.	You said you were visiting friends!
What are you doing?	It's a mess.
What about that?	I tried it.
I tried it.	How about the thingy next to it?
You listening to me?	Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!	Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.	You always stutter?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...	Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.	You prefer nights?
You on some kind of work plan?	You mean like benefits?
You mean like benefits?	Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?	It's not that kind of job.
It's not that kind of job.	You should start a union.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?	Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?	Yeah, yeah, sorry...
I was only going one way.	Drop me off here!
Drop me off here!	Look, I'm sorry --
Look, I'm sorry --	Just drop me off.
Are you crazy?!	The guy came right at us!
The guy came right at us!	You turned up a one way street!
I never told her.	Why the hell not?
Why the hell not?	I, uh, I have some problems.
Saved you last night's, too.	Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
I love you, too.	Now she tells me.
They changed Franklin's portrait.	You think it's a conspiracy?
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?	I can't promise you anything.
Without a song in my heart.	Without a love of my own.
Blue moon... Blue moon...	Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?	Because he believed me.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.	Then tell me what happened.
He gave it to me.	I don't understand.
I don't understand.	Where were you the day he died?
Where were you the day he died?	At a horse show.
Did you kill him?	Is that what they told you?
Is that what they told you?	Did you kill my father?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.	Where'd you get your subscribers?
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.	You haven't been bothering them, have you?
He's why you punish yourself.	Not this again.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.	Is this your dad?
Is this your dad?	That was him.
That was him.	Is he dead?
Is he dead?	Please put it down.
Please put it down.	How'd he die?
How'd he die?	He was murdered.
So what's the question?	How is it possible?
Has this happened to you before?	Never, but I've been practicing.
Never, but I've been practicing.	Who are you, Jerry?
Who are you, Jerry?	Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
What are you doing?	Getting rid of my hub!
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?	Never heard of him.
Pretty scary, huh?	Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
I've been reading up on it.	Are these yours?
If my universe had a hub...	This would be it?
You want something to drink?	Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?	Yeah.  I think so.
Nothing is easy.	How long have we known each other, Jerry?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?	Six months.  Eleven days.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.	As opposed to?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.	Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.	Figure of speech.  Could we go?
He says a dog bit his nose.	Arf... You gotta help me.
Arf... You gotta help me.	I can't promise you anything.
You saved my life.	<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
People do have heart attacks.	Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
What's the charge?	You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
I bit the bastard's nose off.	You bit someone's nose off?
You going to warn him?	I can't promise you anything.
I can't promise you anything.	You think I'm crazy.
You think I'm crazy.	I think you're different.
Do you still ride?	Not for years.
Liza Sutton is dead.	Then I can't be hurt anymore.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.	You've never seen her run.
I'm a very patient man.	That's great.  Good for you.
Do I know you?	Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
I don't know...	Then screw you.  I'll rot.
You made your decision yet?	I'm leaning toward no.
I'm not sure what you mean.	You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
It's okay.  I'm game.	I want this box rigged with a beacon!
In Jerry's safety deposit box.	I don't understand.
Where'd you get it?	You do recognize it then?
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.	Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.	You sound so sure.
I'm still listening.	Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --	I don't believe you.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.	And what did I say?
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?	Yes, that's right.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.	We're very specialized.
We're very specialized.	Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
And you have no idea where he lives?	You've asked me that one three times.
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.	A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Can I ask you something?	A dog bit it.
Liza, settle a bet for us.	What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.	Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
Federal Bureau of Investigation.	I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
What do you suggest?	That you come with me.
That you come with me.	I don't think so.
Do you believe me?	Yeah, I do.
Yeah, I do.	I want to believe you, too.
I want to believe you, too.	What do you mean?
Can I talk to you a second?	Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.	Your call.  Have a good night.
Which way did he go?	I don't know.  Didn't see him.
We've lost contact.	Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.	There's no plug to pull.

Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?	Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?

Oh?  How's he doing?	Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.	Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.	I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
You can't just pull the plug, David.	It's not like you've given me much choice.
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.	How soon will you be able to decode it?
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.	I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.	Put it on speakers.

Could we hear to the moon?	Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.	Could we hear God?
Talk to him.	But what do I say?
But what do I say?	Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.	I can't move any smaller.
The systems integration site.	Mmm.  Look closer.

I can't do this --	What are you so afraid of?
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?	-- I don't know --
I can't hear this now --	Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
So.  The final countdown.	The final countdown.
The final countdown.	Oh.  I brought you something.
It's getting late...	What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
Something like that.	And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
Some of my best friends are scientists.	I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Maybe you're creating a monster.	I don't think so.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.	In other words.

I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?	No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Can you drive?	I can drive.
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.	You could get your wish at any moment.

It was just a little going-away gesture.	I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?	I miss Beast a lot, too.

What about the engagement party?	Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.	But everything's OK?
What do you think of this one?	I'd have to see it on.
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?	She said she'd be here at 10.
And the party?	Yeah, it'll be fun.
Just go ahead and tell us.	There's nothing to tell.
What's up with you?	Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Don't be fresh.	Just remember that I love him.
Must you walk so quickly?	It's good exercise, Mom.
I'm only looking out for you.	And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
I haven't had a crush since I was	When did you start smoking?
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.	You too, Mom.

How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?	I'll be running it three days a week, and...
I'll be running it three days a week, and...	Will you get time off to do that?
Will you get time off to do that?	Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
You can only do what feels best to you now.	I guess so. I think that's right.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.	It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
Letty, you should be in bed.	There's a spider in my room.
I guess I should go now.	You should go.
What are we going to do?	What do you want to do?
Well then why'd it happen?	I don't know. I don't fucking know.
I sure know what that feels like.	And all the plans we have.
And all the plans we have.	Yeah, the plans.
I guess we need to talk.	I guess so.
I guess so.	It's hard to know where to start.
Silly?   Silly am I?	Michael, take it easy.
Michael, take it easy.	Silly, silly, silly.
Silly, silly, silly.	I think I should call someone.
What do you mean not taking your meds?	Why'd you tell?
What is it? Are you OK?	Always the drugs.
I saw you talking to my Mom.	We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?	It wasn't exactly a lie.
Something like that.	When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.	How about a dance?
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.	I got worried. Are you OK?
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.	You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.	The restaurant, too?
The restaurant, too?	I couldn't even face that one.
The store was busy.	You got wine. That's great.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.	I think I should go home.
I think I should go home.	Are you OK?
Are you OK?	Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
Who ever said sanity was fun?	It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
This must be Beast.	That's Mr. Beast to you.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.	I'll see you tonight.
You've got to see the kitchen first.	Do you like it?
Do you like it?	I love your apartment.
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?	Aren't you ever quiet?
I better make a list.	List schmist. You'll remember.
So, it's over?	All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
Tell me all.	I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.	So there were no problems?
So there were no problems?	Not a one.
Not a one.	And did you go to the mission?
It's a good thing my family loves you.	Your family just met me.
I have a terrible confession.	Tell the doctor.
Tell the doctor.	I don't like lamb.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.	I wish I could have seen that.
I wish I could have seen that.	I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.	What are the delusions like?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.	Really?    Me too.
Wow.    I'm bad news.	What's my rap?
What's my rap?	Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?	Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
A daisy for the lady.	The lady knows this is a dandelion.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.	A rose is a rose.
Don't be ridiculous.	Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
We'll get caught.	No rounds for another three hours.
A small price.	I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Really, this isn't funny.	OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Guess which hand.	Enough with the abracadabra.
He asked me to marry him.	Very romantic setting.
Very romantic setting.	It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.	So are you engaged, or what?
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.	I wasn't hungry.
But you're checking it out.	I've already checked it out 17 times.
"Hey there. They're showing ""Groundhog Day"" if you..."	You took bets on my diagnosis?
You took bets on my diagnosis?	It's no big deal.   We all compare.
It's no big deal.   We all compare.	Who do you think you are?
A while, I guess.	That must be really difficult.
Yes?   Go right ahead.	Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.	It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?	I answered these questions last night.
I think I've heard this speech before.	I'm really sorry.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.	Michael.   Yes.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.	I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.	Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
It doesn't matter who.	Have you been seeing another teacher?
No, you've done a perfect job.	So, what do you say, Let?
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.	Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?	I think we need to talk about some things.
I think we need to talk about some things.	Yes, I suppose so.
Yes, I suppose so.	This has been really difficult, this whole thing.
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.	Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.	Are you all right?
Are you all right?	That's a big question.
That's a big question.	I hope it wasn't something I did.
I hope it wasn't something I did.	Something you did?
What are you doing?	Can you loan me a 20?
I'm going to the store.	I think you're overreacting.
Forget I asked.	I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.	Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.	No, it's not like that.
You don't have a fever.	I don't feel like going to work today.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.	Good going. I knew you could do it.
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.	The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
What does that mean?	I need someone to work on budget projections.
How's it look?	Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.	I like those sapphire earrings myself.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.	Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
All tapped out.	I'll float you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.	Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.	Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.	What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.	You killed her!
Do you know who this is?	Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Zero.   That's all I know.	You'll never get out of the city.
Hey man, you can't do that!	What?   This?
Not today.   Where are your friends?	They left about a half hour ago.
They left about a half hour ago.	Where did they go?
My number's going to show up on his bill!	Should I call you back?
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.	C'mon, Laurant, America?
Where's your brother?	Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
I'm good.   Really.	Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
-- Super what?	Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.	Okay.   How much?
Okay.   How much?	I'm not here to negotiate.
I'm not here to negotiate.	Why are you here?
Why are you here?	To tell you that we're interested in the property.
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?	Good.   I'm good.
Good.   I'm good.	Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?	He missed three weeks.
They're gonna be what?	Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
And for my help I would get what?	Half the tapes.
Half the tapes.	And the other half?
And the other half?	I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.	I only have your word for that.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.	He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.	I assume you want something?
I guess we're going to find out.	You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.	What kind of business?
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!	Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Why is everything an argument with you?	I'm just setting my boundaries.
Get that, will you?	Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Why do I always have to answer the phone?	Because you're the closest.
Because you're the closest.	I'm not any closer than you are.
Bring me the scissors.	And the Vodka.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!	You want Zero to kill him?
You want Zero to kill him?	I'm going to kill him myself!
I'm going to kill him myself!	What about the money?
I just want you there in case there's trouble.	And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
Hopefully no one.	No one? Then why is Zero here?
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.	Where are you from?
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.	We'll think of something.
Do they come with batteries?	You didn't buy batteries?
You didn't buy batteries?	I thought they came with batteries.
I thought they came with batteries.	I can't believe you didn't check.
Turn on the flashlight.	I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
We still have to get out of here.	Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?	I think he's already figured that out.
Did you have to use that much explosive?	I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
You haven't answered my question.	Does it really matter what I say?
What'd you get?	Some bread and...
All right, knock it off.	All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Okay, we're square now, right?	There's just one more thing I need you to do.
What do you want now?	Guns.   Can you get them?
Guns.   Can you get them?	Man, I can get anything.
Man, I can get anything.	Don't bullshit me.
Why haven't you turned us in?	I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.	Hector, don't interrupt me.
Hector, don't interrupt me.	He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Good song though.	Great fuckin' song.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.	Oh, I'm sorry.
They were all French guys.	French guys?    You mean like from France?
French guys?    You mean like from France?	Yeah, French guys from France.
Yeah, French guys from France.	What'd they take?
"You didn't say find them. You said, ""get them."""	Just find them!
The Holiday Hotel.	What room number?
What room number?	I don't know.     I didn't look.
What'd you guys find?	Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.	And the other car?
What do we do?	I was told to take what we have and go.
I was told to take what we have and go.	Go where?   The police are outside.
No, I didn't.	Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
What about transportation?	You can use my car.
They don't have a wine list.	Oh, then we will have the house wine.
We've got to get out of here.	That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
They don't serve wine here.	What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.	What is it you do, Sami?
When we get to the next corner jump out.	I'm not going to leave you.
I'm not going to leave you.	We both know I'm already dead.
I knew I should have driven.	Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm the driver.	I've never driven a Cadillac before.
How about Canada?	What are we going to do, take a taxi?
What the hell is he talking about?	I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
God, I want to go home.	Hey, you know you can't this in France.
-- I want to be Elvis.	It's my idea.
It's my idea.	C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.	Okay.   You can be Elvis.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.	Yeah, I can see that.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?	Get in the car.
Get in the car.	Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
Anybody know about that car outside?	Yeah.   It's mine.
Yeah.   It's mine.	No.   It's mine.
No.   It's mine.	The hell it is.
Fuck you, grease-ball!	Fuck me?   Fuck you!
How are we going to do that?	I know where she went.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?	No thank you.
The money isn't here.	Where is it, Sophie?
I think we went the wrong way.	Oh, you think?
He speaks about himself in the third person?	Feel free to correct him if you want.
And how do we do that?	I don't know.
What does arresting us get them?	You wanna tell him?
I can't even hear myself think.	How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
Who are you waiting for?	Stick around and find out.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.	It's not your fault.
Who's gonna see it there?	The lucky ones.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?	Something like that.
Something like that.	Did she break your heart?
Did she break your heart?	Something like that.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.	You got it in a bar?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.	It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
You ever hear of jet lag?	Take a nap.
Okay.    Okay.	I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
She seems pleasant enough.	She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!	That's why we're only breaking one arm.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.	I didn't have the heart.
I didn't have the heart.	Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
How's the arm?  Still sore?	Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.	Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.	I'll go and make up his room!
I don't care about your sword.	Why were you spying on the Yus?
Who are you?	Wait!  I'm a friend!
Why do you want to teach me?	I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.	And if I use them to kill you?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!	Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Where's your master?	What's it to you?
I'm just playing around.	Tell me, who is your master?
I'll never live as a thief!	You're already a thief.
I owe you nothing.	Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?	He is my defeated foe!
You don't seem to understand.	So what if I don't?
This spells trouble.	I have a guest.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.	Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.	Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Put them down.	I heard you met Shu Lien today.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.	Do you know her?
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.	Come and get it if you can.
Come and get it if you can.	Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Here you must be in proper attire.	I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.	I'll give them to you.
I'll give them to you.	I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.	Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
You're doing calligraphy?	I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
You're not married, are you?	What do you think?
What do you think?	No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.	You're probably right.
You're too young to understand.	You're a sword fighter too?
What do you want?	What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.	Not another lecture!  On guard!
Not another lecture!  On guard!	Let's end this here.
Let's end this here.	Only the sword will settle this.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?	"""A faithful heart makes wishes come true."""
"""A faithful heart makes wishes come true."""	Make a wish, Lo.
Let them look.	It is trouble for me.
Give me back my comb.	I don't take orders from anyone.
I don't take orders from anyone.	Give it back.
Let's stop a moment.	Give it back!
Save your strength.	My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?	We followed Jade Fox.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.	What about you?
What about you?	I'll look around and catch up later.
I knew she would intrigue you.	She needs direction... and training.
Have you questioned him yet?	No, not yet...
No, not yet...	But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.	Then, why did you come?
Then, why did you come?	Well, we had talked...
Jade Fox?  Impossible.	You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.	I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
But something is going on at the Yu household.	What have you discovered?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.	It's time for me to leave it behind.
It's time for me to leave it behind.	So what will you do now?
I left the training early.	Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
Mu Bai...It's been too long.	It has.  How's business?
It has.  How's business?	Good.  And how are you?
It's Jade Fox!	We must avenge mother!
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?	Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.	But the sword could be in his compound.
And you're gonna tell me who.	Who ever made that.
Well, hello there...chocolate,	Don't thank me.
They couldn't do anything for me.	How 'bout the morgue?
How 'bout the morgue?	No.  I have one more thing to do.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.	Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.	It's only a flesh wound.
It's only a flesh wound.	It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.	My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
I'm sorry as hell, man.	Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
And I say I'm dead... and I move.	No further.  I'm serious.
At least it finally stopped raining.	It can't rain all the time.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.	I lost my key.
Fun -- look at that guy...	It's just the dope, don't worry
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.	In a better place.  I hope.
In a better place.  I hope.	You're not gonna come back, are you?
What's going on...?	A remembrance.  A closure.
You gotta go now, I bet.	I have to go.
Does she have a name?	No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
You look like a rock star without a job.	I dabble.  May I?
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.	Mom tried to cook.
What's goin' on, Elly?	I went to see a friend of mine.
I went to see a friend of mine.	Well, how's your friend?
Well, how's your friend?	She's still dead.
I don't know you.	I'd like to get in touch with him.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...	Victims.  Aren't we all.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.	I don't know you...
That's ancient history.	It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
Do you know what you destroyed?	Take the dope, too.
Another jolly nickname?	You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Cute nickname, don't you think?	I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
I wish to possess what you have now.	I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Don't waste my time.	Very well, it's your ass.
You'll be alone.	I'm already alone.
Glad to see you're finally with the program.	Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
What the hell are you?	Interested?  Follow the crow.
Coupla more rings... 24k.	18k.  Crap.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.	Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
We've got company.	Is he inside?
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.	Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Who got himself what?	One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
Are you okay?	I'll be fine.
Have we met?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	Did you know Sebastian well?
Did you know Sebastian well?	You might say that.
You promise not to say anything?	On my mother's life.
What do you mean?	Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
But you knew this was important to me.	What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.	What are you saying?
What are you saying?	Why aren't you understanding?
Why aren't you understanding?	I love you.
This isn't working out for me anymore.	Yeah, me neither.
Please don't go.	Get off me.
I just came to say goodbye.	Where are you going?
I think that's for the best.	Good for you.
You know what? I don't take it back.	Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?	Because I'm in love with you.
Because I'm in love with you.	I thought you said we were going to be friends.
That's not fair.	Why can't we be together?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.	You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.	Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Who's Monsieur Philipe?	You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Am I bothering you?	Not at all. Have a seat.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.	Yes it does.
Yes it does.	No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.	I can't win with you.
Alone again.  What are you up to today?	I'm doing some volunteer work.
I'm doing some volunteer work.	Need any company?
Need any company?	You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
What are you reading?	Of Human Bondage.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.	You're not gonna start that again.
No, not at all.	Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.	I'm... I'm alright.
I'm... I'm alright.	How was your date?
How was your date?	It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?	It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
You don't even know me.	Don't you believe in love at first sight?
That's none of your business.	How about tonight?
Need a lift?	No thank you.
No thank you.	How are you today?
How are you today?	Give it up.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.	Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
I never said that.	You implied it.
You implied it.	Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.	Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
I sincerely doubt it.	Give me the fucking letter.
Excuse me. Excuse me!	You talking to me?
Romantic? He rapes her.	That's a matter of opinion.
That's a matter of opinion.	You need help.
I must say I found it rather appalling.	That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
How do you know I've been with several women?	A friend wrote me.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -	- none taken -
Where did you say she's from?	Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
I don't think that bothered him.	What do you mean?
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.	Doctor King is my favorite.
Oh, I suck. I suck.	Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Where did you find those?	Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.	Those are my letters!
It's like a secret society.	That's one way of looking at it.
What do I do then?	Well did you like it?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.	Something awful happened last night.
Something awful happened last night.	What do you mean?!
What do you mean?!	I... I don't think you want to know.
I... I don't think you want to know.	Cecile, you have to tell me.
Cecile, you have to tell me.	It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.	Does your mother know?
Why didn't you do something?	I don't know.
Well... not exactly.	He made you give him a blow job.
Did you hide the letters?	Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
You'd do that for me?	Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Well do you like him?	I don't know.
That was cool.	Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.	What are you saying?
What are you saying?	Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.	Is it that obvious?
See that wasn't so bad.	It was nothing.
Are you for real?	Do you want to learn or not?
Do you want to learn or not?	I guess. It still sounds gross.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?	Eww. No. That's gross.
What was that?	I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
Where are you going?	I'm taking a shower.
I'm taking a shower.	Need any company?
Want a blow job?	Good night Cecile.
Is it me?	No, you were fine.
Am I suppose to be this sore?	For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Want to join me?	Some other time, Cecile.
What are you doing?	You promised to let me kiss you.
And then I can go home?	Of course. I'm not a monster.
I'm sorry that was out of line.	I want to go home.
I want to go home.	I was just kidding.
I was just kidding.	I want to go home.
What are you doing?	Just taking your photo.
Just taking your photo.	I look terrible.
You think he'll like it?	He'll love it.
What year are you in?	I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.	But I thought high school is only four years.
But I thought high school is only four years.	It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.	How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?	Good luck, Sebastian.
Good luck, Sebastian.	What, nervous I'm going to win?
What, nervous I'm going to win?	Would you please leave.
It works a little.	No it doesn't. I see right through you.
I think that's all the time we have for today.	Same time next week?
Same time next week?	No. This is going to be our last session.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?	Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
He told me he loved me and I believed him.	Who told you?
Who told you?	You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
Is she with you?	Who is this?
Who is this?	Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Where is she?!	I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
And you think she bought it?	I'm pretty sure she did.
I'm pretty sure she did.	Pretty sure or sure sure?
Pretty sure or sure sure?	She bought it.
She bought it.	I'll be in touch.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.	Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Greg, is that you under the covers?	Get out of here.
Oh baby... oh baby...	Baby?  Right on time.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.	What do you mean?
Pleased to meet you.	Likewise I'm sure.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.	I accept. Now get out.
I accept. Now get out.	Get out? We had an arrangement.
Get out? We had an arrangement.	Didn't you hear what I said?
I think you have your answer.	War it is.
Get off me!	Will you calm down?
Will you calm down?	Fine! Get off me!
In any event, you still owe me my reward.	I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
I thought we should celebrate.	I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.	I have a flair for drama.
I have a flair for drama.	Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?	You wanted an answer to your question.
Why so nervous?	I've never done this before.
I've never done this before.	How have you dumped girls in the past?
How have you dumped girls in the past?	Screening calls. Any suggestions?
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.	At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.	Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.	Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.	No, I'm not.
I'm not in the mood.	And that's why you're leaving?
And that's why you're leaving?	It clearly is why.
It clearly is why.	I want to fuck.
I want to fuck.	And I don't.
Tell me all the details.	It was... Fantastic.
It was... Fantastic.	Oh come on. For her first time?
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.	Where is she?
Where is she?	You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.	Where'd she go?
She shot you down.	Exactly the opposite.
Exactly the opposite.	So what went wrong?
Who are you spying on?	Take a look for yourself.
Moving along quite well.	Have you succeeded in your task?
Have you succeeded in your task?	Any day now.
Any day now.	Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
I'm at your service.	Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.	Oh sis. You're so tense.
Fuck her yet?	I'm working on it.
Be more specific.	In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?	Could you be more desperate to read it?
Care to make a wager on that?	I'll think about it...
Let me get that for you.	Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.	It's the least I can do.
I can't thank you enough.	You will be discreet about this?
I hope I didn't keep you from something.	Not at all. What's wrong?
Ronald? That's crazy.	I know. She's so young and he's so -
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.	Is that so?
I'll do that.	It's really important.
It's really important.	I understand. Good night.
What do you want?	I need to talk to Annette.
I need to talk to Annette.	She's not here.
She's not here.	Do you know where she is?
Do you know when she'll be back?	Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Young man, I already told you she's not here.	Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
It's desperate that I talk to her.	I've already told you, she's not home.
I've already told you, she's not home.	Well please leave a message that I called.
Well please leave a message that I called.	I'll do that.
I said, do you want some water?	Oh... no thank you...
Right after we played backgammon.	We played backgammon?
We played backgammon?	Uh huh. You beat me three times.
What time is it?	Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Eight o'clock. You got to go.	Did she show up?
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.	Don't worry about it.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?	Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?	Did you hit her?
Did you hit her?	Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.	You're a lucky guy.
You're a lucky guy.	She really loves me.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?	Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.	But quite harmless, I'm sure.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.	All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
Where'd you get this, darling?	It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?	She was very pretty.
She was very pretty.	What's her name?
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.	I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
I got my wish anyway.	You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.	But it's already come true.
But it's already come true.	Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?	On the back street  a green house
On the back street  a green house	The Farren house
The Farren house	Do you know the people?
But where did you get it, Amy?	At the old house with the voice.
Did you ever make a wish?	Oh, lots of times.
Oh, lots of times.	Did your wishes ever come true?
What are saying, darling?	I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
I haven't had my breakfast.	Well, you know where it is.
What is it, Alice?	I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
Did you hear the child out?	Well, it seemed to me --
I'm never unfair.	You're shouting at me.
Where is everybody?	It's early yet.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?	I forgot I had it on.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.	I know that.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.	I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?	No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.	I live right here.
I live right here.	Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
But there's no one here, darling.	She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.	Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?	Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
In the garden? Would she be there now?	She's there whenever I call her!
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?	Because she is my friend.
Just you wait!	And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
These are all from me.	"This one says, ""To Mother from Amy."""
No, I didn't.	Voices from an old dark house!
And who did the voice belong to?	It was just a voice.
Daddy, it's true.	Let me be the judge of that.
They ran away.	Why didn't you run after them?
But wishes don't come true.	Certain wishes do.
Did you mail then?	Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.	Where did you mail them?
Where did you mail them?	I'll show you.
What'd you get for Christmas?	I don't know yet.
I don't know yet.	My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.	Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
You mustn't be afraid.	But she's dead!
But she's dead!	Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.	Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.	But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
It's you...Irena...my friend!	Don't cry, Amy.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.	You wanted to share this moment with me.
You wanted to share this moment with me.	It stands so still.
May I pet the deer?	It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.	I want to touch it.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.	Oh, thank you, Amy.
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.	That one's an elm.
Can't you get it, darling?	I'll just never learn arithmetic.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.	But you must!
But you must!	The numbers simply don't mean anything
You'll always play with me?	Whenever you want.
Who are you?	You called me by my name.
You called me by my name.	Irena. But who are you?
Irena. But who are you?	I'm your friend.
I'm your friend.	I've wanted a friend.
I've wanted a friend.	I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.	But where do you come from?
But where is that?	I can not tell you.
I can not tell you.	Will you be friend for always?
Will you be friend for always?	For as long as you'll let me.
For as long as you'll let me.	I shall want you for always.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.	But what happened to the little deer?
Because it can't. It's dead.	But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!	It got hit.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.	But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
Will you come soon?	Soon as I finish.
I'm trying to.	Let me take another look at that ring.
Look at my ring.	That's a fine-looking ring.
That's a fine-looking ring.	A lady threw it to me.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?	Don't you read Shakespeare?
The Headless Horseman --	Why hasn't he got a head?
Mommy read it to ne.	"Do you know the story of ""The Headless Horseman?"""
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?	No, thank you.
But I only came to give back the ring.	The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Mother! You called me by name!	Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.	And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!	Yes...yes, that's true.
Yes...yes, that's true.	And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?	It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?	Anybody could know that song.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.	My daughter died long ago.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.	That's from her -- that woman.
Let the child stay.	Now, I don't know Amy --
I like to see her happy.	So do I, Mr. Reed.
And Amy mailed them?	She pleaded so to do it
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?	Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.	Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
Waiter! She needs more water.	Can we get some service here?
Wow your body's really hot.	I've been working out.
I've been working out.	I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?	Never felt better.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...	Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.	Yeah but they looked cool...
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.	I've changed a lot lately.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?	Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
How's the rest of your health?	Good. Except for PMS.
A dog at Victoria's Secret?	No, it was another woman.
There was a sale.	I mean where on your body?
I mean where on your body?	Oh, on my wrist.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?	At Victoria's Secret.
"We're worried about you. ""60 Minutes"" was on same-sex couples."	What does that have to do with me?
I think George knows.	About Mark? Carlton?
Did I kill a guy named Benito?	No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
I guess you'll find out.	No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.	No. I won't let you do that.
What choice do we have?	So what do I do?
So what do I do?	Fall in love.
Fall in love.	I think I already have.
I think I just got my period.	Does that mean this whole thing is over?
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.	Why the fuck would you do that?
Why the fuck would you do that?	I could smell another woman on him.
DON'T call the police.	Why not? There's been a murder.
What? Why'd you do that?	There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.	You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
Holy shit, I don't know.	Did you get rid of Mark?
He's been here all night?	Yeah, I guess. Mark?
Get rid of him!	Okay, I gotta go.
Okay, I gotta go.	I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
I've been here. What day is it?	Tuesday. Are you okay?
Tuesday. Are you okay?	Shit, I guess I missed work.
Shit, I guess I missed work.	Frida, Carlton's dead.
And he was missing an arm.	Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.	I haven't gotten it yet.
So where's this infamous arm now?	I put it down the garbage disposal.
I put it down the garbage disposal.	And what makes you think you killed a man?
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.	No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!	No they're not.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.	No you don't, believe me.
What did he say?	I think he called you beautiful.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.	I looked like an Italian man!
Give him the tampon test.	What the hell is the tampon test?
Rule one: always wear make-up.	I wonder if he's married.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.	My vision got worse again.
So did you do it?	Did I kill him? Of course not!
Did I kill him? Of course not!	No, did you fuck him?
No, did you fuck him?	No. I don't think so.
No. I don't think so.	You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
At least your PMS is over.	And my bra finally fits again.
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?	There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.	And he was ripped limb from limb?
And he was ripped limb from limb?	I'm sure they were exaggerating.
I'm sure they were exaggerating.	Why would they exaggerate?
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!	I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.	Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?	And she got the medium.
Where are all the mediums?	Frida, grab that red one.
Or if there's a full moon.	Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Do you really need these?	Only to see.
Only to see.	Can't you get contacts?
He hasn't said one word to me.	Maybe he's just shy.
I get a little bloated sometimes.	I'd kill for just a little bloated.
Translation: a total geek.	Anything's better than Mark.
Anything's better than Mark.	My shrink says he's not so bad.
I really gotta pee.	You should have gone at the restaurant.
You should have gone at the restaurant.	I didn't have to pee then.
I didn't have to pee then.	My apartment's just such a mess.
Oh come on. Knock it off.	Knock what off?
Knock what off?	You don't have to pee.
You don't have to pee.	Yes I do have to pee!
Uh huh. So pee.	So pee? Here?
I'm really tired.	Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
They say sex is great for cramps.	Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
Well, whattdaya think?	That's great. Highly original.
So you're Grant's secretary?	I do development for TV movies.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.	My bra is my biggest supporter.
It's a matter of life and death.	This really isn't a good time.
Where'd you get the bike?	I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?	Frida, you know you're it for me.
Frida, you know you're it for me.	Yeah right... You better go.

Oh my god, I'm sorry!	Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.	I can't help it, it smells so good.
You look different. I mean you look good.	You never say that.
You never say that.	You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
What, you got a date or somethin'?	Since when do you care?
Yes, that's what we're looking for.	I think we should do something with strong female characters...
"How about a ""Man in Jeopardy"" story?"	Did you change your hair?
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.	Worse than this?
Go away. I might hurt you.	I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.	Peter I love you too but...
Peter I love you too but...	I don't think you'll hurt me.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.	No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
Your breasts feel larger.	They do? Oh no...
You didn't say it.	I love you too.
Except Mark of course.	What's that supposed to mean?
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?	Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
Was there anything in that washer?	No. Nope, nothing in it.
No. I was doing my laundry.	I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?	My period? No.
My mom used to get PMS too.	Used to? Did it stop finally?
Used to? Did it stop finally?	No, she died when I was twelve.
You wanna get some coffee?	I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.	So what book did you buy?
So what book did you buy?	Oh, it's nothing.

I ate a guy last night.	And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?	I don't know. I don't remember doing it.

Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?	Take some allergy medicine.
Take some allergy medicine.	You can't believe this bullshit.
It's for you. Frida.	Tell her I'm eating.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?	Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
See he was cheating from the get go.	He's been running money for the Mafia.
You want her sheets?	We can just take this pillowcase.
How the hell is that your business?	We're just trying to figure out what happened.
And that was 28 days ago today.	Did we get those DNA tests back?
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.	What makes her think that?
He means the last that we know of.	This one walk you home too?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.	And he was missing an arm.

I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --	And what about Daniel Webster?
And what about Daniel Webster?	Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.	And serve him right!
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?	Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.	All right, Daniel. Jump in.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!	No! No! I won't.
But I like the new one better.	That's just too bad --
Loan shark -- hey?	Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.	Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
You're not -- Dorothy.	No. She's gone.
No. She's gone.	She couldn't be gone!
What's the matter with you?	You are afraid!
You are afraid!	Afraid ... of what?
Afraid ... of what?	-- of what happens after we die!
But what becomes of our souls?	Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?	Don't say that -- I know it is --
Don't say that -- I know it is --	All right -- so it's buried with you!
Mornin', Jabez ...	Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
-- in gold.	I'd like to know where you'd get it....
You know darn well it is.	Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?	I'm through with you.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.	He was --
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.	Look here now--
I don't care.	But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.	Leave your tongue off of that!
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?	Well, I --
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?	Ten throws it is.
You are not so sure that he'll come.	Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?	Why not -- ?
Why of course --	Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
But -- I was just lucky.	Well? Don't a politician have to be?
You must go now, Mary -- you must!	All right, Jabez ...
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.	What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Why don't they come --	I don't know, Jabez.
But Jabez, I never said that!	It shows on your face.
What happened.... Where are you taking him?	I am going to lock him up.
I am going to lock him up.	You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!	Oh -- Jabez.
There is nothing to worry about now.	You'll never change -- will you?
We must go on home, Jabez.	Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
What do you think of that, Jabez?	Looks right elegant, Mary.
It feels fine now, Jabez.	Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?	I'd love to.
Well -- what are we going to do?	We can still use my butter money.
We can still use my butter money.	Your butter money?
Your butter money?	Do you think I'm grudging it?
Do you think I'm grudging it?	Mary -- it's gone.
Mary -- it's gone.	Not all of it?
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?	To save us work on the spring plowing?
My son ... what's the matter?	Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Ma -- is she? --	You'll be a father any minute now.
It don't matter!	What's that you say, Son?
What's that you say, Son?	I say -- it don't matter.
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.	Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?	I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.	Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Helps sometimes to say it.	All right, son -- if it helps.
You know that, son.	Hard luck -- like me.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.	Very well, folks. I accept.
Let him try it.	The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!	Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.	I guess we won't.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.	Mary -- Jabez --
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?	I'll do my best, Mary.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.	-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.	Pretty good -- that's perfect!
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.	Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.	I'll be there, too!
I want someone to talk to ...	You can talk to me ...
Why don't you?	I can't be honest with them.
How 'bout some Christmas music?	That is Christmas music.

But meant her moving here.	Closer to Japan.  You're fast.

If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!	I don't want neutral...I want dead --

Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?	I don't know.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.	You say 'fuck' a lot.
You say 'fuck' a lot.	You fuck for money.
Do you enjoy it?	When they deserve it.
When they deserve it.	Did they deserve it today?
Did they deserve it today?	I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.	But you did it anyway.
But you did it anyway.	Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.	Yes.  But do you know?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.	Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?	Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.	How'd she meet Patchett?
Tell me about Patchett.	He's waiting for you to mention mention.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.	You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Can I get you a drink?	Yeah, plain scotch.
Somebody hit you?	It's not what you think.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.	That obvious, huh?
That obvious, huh?	It's practically stamped on your forehead.
Give me one minute.	You've got it, Wendell.
Will you work for me?	Of course... But how?
Of course... But how?	How what, Wendell?
How what, Wendell?	How'd you get them to retract?
<u>What do you want</u>?	Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.	Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
Captain, what do you want?	Call me Dudley.
Call me Dudley.	Dudley, what do you want?
Lad, may I have a word with you?	This business, Captain?
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.	I got to write my report first.
You know him?	Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
Was it... a rat?	Yeah.  A great big one.
What's through here?	No!  Please leave!
Stens?  Was it Stens?	Maybe.  I don't know.
Maybe.  I don't know.	Look at a picture for me.
Let my daughter rest in peace.	Five minutes.  That's all.
You expecting problems?	Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.	Which one are you and which one am I?
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.	It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.	It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
One in six.  Where's the girl?	Officer White, put down that weapon and --
Yeah, that's Stens.	Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Where are we going?	It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Thanks, but no thanks.	Against your code?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?	Wait.  Our deal still holds?
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?	I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.	What do you mean?
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?	I got a few Nite Owl questions.
What do you want to know?	Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Where are the police academy files?	I don't have time.  I have --
I don't have time.  I have --	Just show me where they are!
More or less.	Until he gunned down six people.
I heard you like to shoot dogs.	Dogs got no reason to live.
Dogs got no reason to live.	Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?	Man, what're you saying?
Man, what're you saying?	Ray, we got the shotguns.
Ray, we got the shotguns.	I don't own no shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.	Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
I never truck with no sissies!	That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?	Say what and so what.
Say what and so what.	Did one of the officers work you over a little?
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!	They shot him in his library.
Nobody.  At least not yet.	And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?	Gone.  Not a trace.
But you were business associates?	What does that have to do --
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?	Something like that.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.	Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
No... Where'd the tip come from?	Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.	She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Ed, I want confessions.	I'll break them, sir.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.	Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.	Yes, I do, sir.
Yes, I do, sir.	It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.	So be it.
Dudley, we've been over this.	Answer yes or no.
The youngest applicant by eight years.	You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?	I was thinking Detective Bureau.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.	Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?	I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
What's that for?	Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.	I want to do it right.
I want you to follow Bud White.	Even I'm not that crazy.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?	Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.	You make a mistake?
You make a mistake?	Yeah.  My whole life.
I need to speak to you.	Give me a minute, will ya?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?	You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.	I get the idea.  You got a description?
I get the idea.  You got a description?	Of his penis, sir?
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?	A vulgar term, but yes.
A vulgar term, but yes.	What's her name?
Why's she seeing Bud White?	Why do men and women usually see each other?
Not good enough.	Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
Right now, before I back down.	Where is he?
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.	You're the first person to ever call me tough.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.	Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.	You, me and White, huh?
You, me and White, huh?	Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
How was I?	Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.	You sound like you mean it.
You sound like you mean it.	The silver screen's loss is your gain.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.	How about White?
How about White?	You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.	The way you've underestimated Bud White?
On what evidence?	None.  Call it a hunch.
My daughter was a virgin!	I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Let my Susie rest in peace!	Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
A sweet man.	Under the house.
It seems like my Susan, but...	When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
What's wrong, Trash?	What happened with the kid and Loew?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?	Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What's he doing here, Sid?	You tight with the D.A., trash?
You're back, boychick.	Sid, how are they hanging?
Sid, how are they hanging?	Down around my ankles.
Not a word.	What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.	Sid, it's Vincennes.
Sid, it's Vincennes.	Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
Jack!  It's Christmas!	No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?	Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.	I just called it.
I just called it.	No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
And no one'll know about this?	It'll be our secret.
Was it a party?	Something like that.
Something like that.	Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.	Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?	Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.	Oh?  Anyplace else?
Oh?  Anyplace else?	Working whores with squad two.

Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?	Listen to me--
Listen to me--	Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!	Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Why don't you just call Brill directly.	I don't know who he is.
What kind of a question is that?	A direct one.
What if <u>what</u>?	What if we just fucked with 'em?
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.	Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.	No he won't.
These guys are incredibly persistent.	Tell me about it.
We lost 'em.	That wasn't so hard.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?	Yeah, I can see where that'd--
Think we let out enough air?	Oh my God...
Those are Feds.	I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
What the fuck?!	They shouldn't have come without calling first.

With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...	Neil, thank you for your help.
Well then who can?	Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.

FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.	Are you sure about this?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?	Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--

That was for Christmas.	I was missing you.
Stacy, don't hang up.	Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I know, but listen--	Was that doctored-up, too?
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.	I think you should leave now, Robert.
I see her for business.	You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.	Well, you know--
Well, you know--	He's got his priorities?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Who did you work with to get the--
Who did you work with to get the--	A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
I saw a man die.	What do you mean?
Just for the criminals.	We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.

I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.	Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
And then what?	I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Actually, that's not true.	You didn't squeeze DePinto?
You didn't squeeze DePinto?	No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
Any idea what he looks like?	My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
I <u>did</u> care how.	This conversation's over.
I'm sorry about that.	What makes you think it's you?
What makes you think it's you?	It's not me?
It's not me?	You're a moron, you know that?

Who would do that?	Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
You're firing me.	A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.	I don't under--
She doesn't want to talk to you.	What are you talking--
What are you talking--	She can't talk to you right now.
How long can you stay?	I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.

You're learning a cruel lesson.	Are those my Christmas presents?
Are those my Christmas presents?	Some of 'em.
Some of 'em.	Can I open 'em up?
Can I open 'em up?	Sure, go ahead.

Why don't you give 'em a call.	What about jewelry?
I love my blender.	They didn't take the silverware?
They didn't take the silverware?	No, but they took my blender.
No, but they took my blender.	Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?

Was Zavitz in trouble?	I don't know.
He got hit by a bus.	What does that have to do with you?
What does that have to do with you?	I honestly don't know.
What's your opinion?	It's hard to say for certain, these things are--

I said fuck you.	Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
Dean's with Lyle.	And they have the video. That's confirmed.

If they've looked at the video.	Oh, let's assume that they have.
Oh, let's assume that they have.	If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
He's clever. He had help.	He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
He had help.	Help from whom?  Christ.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.	What about the tapes?

Say you're sick.	What?  No!
What?  No!	Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
What do you hate most?	A lie.  What do you hate most?
You sew very badly.	You don't sew at all!
Will you please come in?	Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Do they know them?	No, but I think I do.
And the marriage - is that a fiction?	No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
Shall we be all right?	Yes.  Absolutely.
Yes.  Absolutely.	Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
What am I looking at?	See what's happening to them - the stars.
See what's happening to them - the stars.	They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
You should come into the shelter.	I'm quite all right, thank you.
I'm quite all right, thank you.	Look over there.
I thought you might paste them into your book.	We took several photographs, there's no need.
We took several photographs, there's no need.	I'd like you to have them.
You sing.  All the time.	I do not.
I do not.	Ask Al Auf. Almsy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
He said - be careful.	Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?	Her or me?
You felt obliged to.	As the wife of one of our party.
How much did you pay?	Hello!  Good morning.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.	I don't want to go back.
I don't want to go back.	This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.	I don't care to bargain.
I don't care to bargain.	That insults them.
It's Geoffrey under this.	I haven't, no.  Sorry.
A broken car?	Still a car.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.	May God make safety your companion.
When's Clifton picking you up?	Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Look, either shut up, or go home.	Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
And where are the Expedition Maps?	In my room.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.	Her hands and feet were tied.
Her hands and feet were tied.	What did you do?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.	Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
Don't cut me.	Or was it Toronto?
Or was it Toronto?	Don't cut me.  Come on.
Is this you?	I don't know.
She can take you as far as Florence.	I can get in the back.
Where did you find that?	I liberated it.
I liberated it.	I think that's called looting.
What if I told you he did this to me?	What?  How could he have?  When?
Supper. Hana calls after him.	Where've you been?
You were in Africa?	Yeah, for a while.
Yeah, for a while.	So was my Patient.
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.	Are you Hana?
Are you Hana?	What do you want?
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.	No, now I can't kill you.
What did you say?	The rest meant nothing to me.
Have a drink.	I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Thought you'd never wake up!	What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.	I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?	Oh, all over.
I'm fine.  I got hot.	Lady H said she thought you might be -
Lady H said she thought you might be -	I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Darling, for goodness' sake!	Well, she is!
Oh no, really.  She has her book.	I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?	Never heard of it.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.	Would you like me to?
I'm still here.	You'd better be.
Arguing about books.	Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
I've been told that before.	Kip's another one.
Why?  Is he staying?	With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
I'll probably marry him.	Really?  That's sudden.
This is Captain McGann.	Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
Well then - yes.  Of course.	Thank you.  Thank you.
He needn't disturb you.	Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.	I can see my wife in that view.
I can see my wife in that view.	Are you remembering more?
Are you remembering more?	Could I have a cigarette?
Could I have a cigarette?	Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?	Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?	Because I'm a nurse.
I can already see.	How?  How can you see anything?
Are you asleep?	Yes.  Dropping off.
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.	I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
I'm not sewing anything else for you!	I love you.
I'll always go back to that church.	So one day we'll meet.
Will you come with me?	Of course.  When?
Of course.  When?	I mean home.  India.
I mean home.  India.	Kip I -
I try not to expect you.	But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?	Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Kip - come and dance with me	Yes.  Later.
No. But he hands them over.	Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Why would anyone do this?	I've done this.  I've had to do this.
So I follow the wires?	You get Hardy.
You get Hardy.	I follow the wires.
For my hair?	Yes, for your hair.
I've met you before.	I don't think so.
He's gone, hasn't he?	No.  He's - no.
No.  He's - no.	Oh God.  Oh God.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.	And what if he really is a spy?
And what if he really is a spy?	He can't even move.
He can't even move.	If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.	When he dies I'll catch up.
You've got a mustache.	A bit of one.
A bit of one.	I was looking forward to this evening.
I was looking forward to this evening.	I had a hotel room.
Whoa - give me a chance!	Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!	Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.
This is wonderful!	What's he saying?
This was your garden?	Or my wife's.
Or my wife's.	Then you were married?
Gin? Where the hell are you?	I'm in the middle.
He's on to something bigger.	Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.	Too late now.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?	We're getting close.
I don't know, but close.	This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.	You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.	Don't overestimate yourself.
Don't overestimate yourself.	Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.	Where are you at least?
Where are you at least?	I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.	Which you have in mind.
We've got to catch him in the act.	Why didn't I think of that?
Why didn't I think of that?	It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
You ordering chop suey again?	Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Through a window.	The windows don't open.
The windows don't open.	Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
You didn't answer the beeper either.	I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?	I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.	I don't recall asking your permission.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.	There are times when you don't answer the phone.
You gave them the eight billion.	You mean the seven billion.
--You're a cop.	Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
Put this on!	I'm not leaving without you.
I cannot get rid of you.	No, you can't.
The door's the only way out!	I sincerely hope not.
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...	The disc is still in there.
The disc is still in there.	We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
Jesus God, it's going through.	Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
The sign of our partnership.	Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
Not for me.	What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
So what are you going to do with your share?	Oh, I don't care about the money.
Oh, I don't care about the money.	Four billion dollars.
Four billion dollars.	Seen one billion, seen them all.
Seen one billion, seen them all.	That's because you grew up rich.
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.	Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
But would you--would you--	Have really held you under?
That was a lifetime ago.	It was wrong to deceive you.
It was wrong to deceive you.	But that's all behind us now.
You have something in mind?	Call it a new tradition.
You shouldn't have.	Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.	There is one more thing.
No way to take another day or two?	No. You'll see when we get inside.
How do I look?	Like a woman of mystery.
There's always a surprise.	I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
So how long till we do this?	We're doing it tonight.
That's where the Mask comes in.	You've thought of everything.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.	It's no good without the argon gas.
Peoples China Bank.	Where the money is.
The eight billion. From them to us.	Right. The eight billion.
Well...What are we doing?	You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
What about the rules?	My job, my rules.
Oh my god, I thought--	I'd taken the Mask?
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?	Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.	There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--	It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.	Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
We're living history here.	You don't know the half of it.
STOP! You're making...mistake.	It's your mistake.
It's your mistake.	The big job.
The big job.	There is no big job.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.	These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.	You can't be too careful.
One, two, three...	You're not on the beat.
It's a party.	Let's mingle a little, shall we?
Popup, on floorboards. And--	In eye of that painting.
So you had to be your own lifeline.	Something like that.
You were afraid of heights?	Terrified. Still am.
Terrified. Still am.	How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
Aren't we early?	Little celebration before we set off.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.	I've got something for you.
That's it. We're ready.	One more item--not on the check list.
A dozen times.	The lipstick thermal camera?
I didn't mean to get personal.	Yes you did.
Did I hear a car?	Our equipment has arrived.
Let's do it again.	Try laps. Say a hundred.
Why don't we take oxygen?	We are...for the tools.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?	Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
On what? Another job?	We get the Mask I'll tell you.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.	A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.	Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.	It was perfect.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.	That's because I wanted them to!
That's because I wanted them to!	I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!	A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.	No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
I go in alone.	You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?	We're doing this together. We're partners.
I know it well.	As I recall, you've robbed it before.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.	Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?	In a week.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.	Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
I don't believe this.	What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.	What's my problem? You want a list?
You stole my luggage? You--	I'm a thief. Sue me.
I'm a thief. Sue me.	Where's my bag?
Those are my clothes.	Certainly not mine. Come on.
What about your bags?	I never carry...baggage.
We're going to die, aren't we...	I'm not the one to ask...
It's one way.	We're only going one way.
What the hell was that?	Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
He says they turned the card down.	Damn, I knew I forgot something.
A film case.	That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
It's a fake.	Give him the card.
It's a test.	That's my girl.
Maybe I should drive this time.	Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
But Roki said--	Roki has a vivid imagination.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.	It's not for sale.
The Empress Death Mask.	The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
For God's sake.	I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
And I thought we were getting on so well.	We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
I've got something for you.	Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?	No. Why would I be?
You're not taking me seriously.	Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
I've got something...	I sincerely hope so.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.	Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
Seems I am.	I'll call an ambulance.
How about if I try humility.	How about if you try disappearing.
Why are we speaking Chinese?	Uh. I'm showing off.
I have a question...	Who am I?
Who am I?	That is of no interest.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?	We need to make the trade tomorrow.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.	Always in a rush.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.	Yes it does.
You're giving them to me?	Call it an expression of trust.
Call it an expression of trust.	Thought you had to use some of these.
You know where my loyalties lie.	To yourself, that's where.
This is just show and tell.	I'm waiting for the tell part.
I'm waiting for the tell part.	She's calling the shots now.
She's calling the shots now.	You're impressed with her, aren't you?
Tonight your league night?	Check out my ball.
You damn well thought wrong.	I'm terribly sorry old man.
You two make quite a couple.	We're supposed to.
We're supposed to.	You better not be taking on a new partner.
You better not be taking on a new partner.	Suspicious, after all these years?
Suspicious, after all these years?	You change partners, you change the rules.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.	Remind me why.
Remind me why.	Because it pays off.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.	How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?	You look like George Washington.
It's too soon.	The early bird gets the damn worm.
The early bird gets the damn worm.	But the second mouse gets the cheese.
Oh, it is.	It better be worth it for me.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.	Black of course.
This is big enough.	It's never big enough.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?	Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.	The key to success is using the right tools.
In the van.	Tina was a wonderful woman.
Tina was a wonderful woman.	Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
Where've you been?	What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?	Don't use language with me --
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.	That's a joke, right?
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.	250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
Fax these to this number, okay?	All of 'em?
All of 'em?	All of them.
What the hell is this doing here?	It's those files you asked for.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.	Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.	Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?	What do you think?  What's this?
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.	So you say.
So you say.	He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.	What's your point?
There's more than one?	Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
I can put them in a good school.	Any school you want.
Any school you want.	And get someone to help around the house.
Five million dollars?	Five million dollars.
The judge came up with a number.	A number for the whole group, or for us?
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --	It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Wow.  Why would they do that?	Cause of the chromium.
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?	You're a lawyer?
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.	You see your office?
You see your office?	Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.	Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.	Here what comes?
Here what comes?	The extortion, the threats ...
The extortion, the threats ...	I wasn't gonna --
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.	How do you know that?
I don't know what to say.	Say you were wrong.
Say you were wrong.	I was wrong.
I was wrong.	Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.	I did.  Both.
When?  Where?	Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
How dare you take that away from me.	No one's taking anything --
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!	Not in my world.
Not in my world.	Gee, I wonder why.
Whoa.  No shit.	It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.	So what are you thinking?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.	And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.	Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
What kind of truck?	I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?	Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
Someone's following me.	What?  Who?
Hey.  I like working with you.	Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
I like this case.	Really?  It makes me sick.
You didn't care about my case?	I would now.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.	Show me the document that proves that.
Is that what I think it is?	She lived on the plume.  You never know.
How many families we talking about here?	Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.	You think there's more?
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.	That's crazy -- why not?
Then I don't get anything either.	And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
And you can't?	What, you think I'm made of money?
Course I did.	Lemme see it, will you?
You do know how to do that, don't you?	Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
All I have is hundreds.	I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.	Bullshit, you don't.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.	I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?	If you hadn't used profanity --
How many counts?	Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Did he say why?	Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.	Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Pattee?  That your middle name?	Nope.  Maiden.
You come to the right place.	I guess I did.
Have you been to the water board?	Hunh-uh.  What's that?
What kind of chromium is it?	There's more than one kind?
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?	I don't know.
It happens all the time.	That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
Yeah.  A real moron.	Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
Mommy, can I get a flower?	Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.	How come you're not eating?
Hey, Ros, where are they?	In the conference --
What's going on in there?	Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.	PG& -- Are you sure?
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.	So did I.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?	Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?	You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.	I will.  Bye.
Think you could learn?	You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
And I miss you.	Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
You already packed up your stuff?	I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
More than you need me.	I need it.
That is not what I'm --	Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
Lock the door.	No, I wanna say hi.
You are someone.	No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
What are you doing here?	Fixing a leak under your sink.
Thanks for reminding me.	I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
What're you doing?	Better safe than sorry.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.	Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Cause I don't even know you.	Yeah, and whose fault is that?
Which number do you want, George?	You got more than one?
Where's my paycheck?	Have you been logging on?
Yes.  It's called accountability.	I am not talking to you, bitch.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.	What's going on?
Someone stole my stuff.	Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.	I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
I know.  It's an awful lot.	I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?	Yeah.  Who are you?
Yes, My Lord.	And code the signal to my private chamber.
Soon, Lord Vader.	Yes, Admiral .... soon.
The boy is our last hope.	No ... there is another.
Will he finish what he begins?	We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
He will learn patience.	Much anger in him, like in his father.
Much anger in him, like in his father.	We've discussed this before.
... Luke, you must not go.	But Han and Leia will surely die.
You must survive, Luke.	I'm cold ... so cold ...
Ben ... Ben ...	Luke ... you are the only hope.
I can't ...	You must.  Luke, look at me!
Three patrol ships are heading our way.	Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Barks a blue streak.	What's wrong with him?
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.	Everyone's invited, of course.
Barks his concern.	No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Well, it's been awhile.	Barks and growls at his boss.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.	Barks his agreement.
Barks his consternation.	Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
We should have stayed and finished them off.	Barks his agreement.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.	Patience.  It's time to eat.
Give me that!	Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.	I'm looking for a great warrior.
... Like we're being watched.	Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?	We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...	We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.	The temperature is dropping too fast.
The temperature is dropping too fast.	You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
What is thy bidding, My Master?	There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.	I have felt it.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.	He will join us or die, My Master.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.	Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.	I'm going to see what it is.
Sir, I was wondering ...	Sit down, and shut up!
Sit down, and shut up!	It can wait.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?	What is it?
You look silly.	You look great.
You look great.	Has Threepio turned up yet?
You keep logs?  My, how organized.	Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.	Never heard of that system.
That depends.  Where are we?	Here ... near the Anoat system.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.	Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
I see it Chewie, hang on.	The entrance is collapsing!
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!	But the tremors have stopped.
You mean a man you can control.	I do not!
I do not!	Try and control this ...
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.	Yes, you do.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.	Would you please stop calling me that?
That was no earthquake.	Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.	I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
You don't look angry.	How do I look?
What is it?	That should do nicely.
I'm against that.	We've got to get out of this shower.
We've got to get out of this shower.	Now you're making sense.
I take it back.	That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
Probably an asteroid field ....	Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.	I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?	Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.	What was it?
An Imperial probe droid.	Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
Yes, Your Highness?	You said you were going to stay. What happened?
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.	Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.	Thanks to you.
Thanks to you.	That's two you owe me, junior.
No hard feelings?	Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?	I always said you were a gentleman.
The deflector shields are gone.	Are the coordinates set?
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!	Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
What'd you say?	I didn't say anything?
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.	You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.	Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.	We have no use for your kind.
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...	... we're the bait.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?	Not yet.  They're working on it now.
Rather touchy, aren't they.	I thought you knew this person.
This hyperdrive had better work.	I've never seen it fail.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?	What are you talking about?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?	If it must be.  Yes.
Ben?  Ben?	Free your mind and return he will.
Free your mind and return he will.	My mind fills with so many images.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.	It is the future you see.
What's in there?	Only what you take with you.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?	No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.	I thought those seekers were set for stun!
I thought those seekers were set for stun!	That they are.
That they are.	They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
I don't believe it.	That is why you fail.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.	I thought I was in good shape.
I have followed my feelings.	You are reckless!
I'll die first.	That won't be necessary.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.	And I too.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.	Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?	It won't get through the blockade.
It won't get through the blockade.	I want that ship.
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.	We know that.
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --	And we can watch ...
And we can watch ...	A display of primitive apparatus --
Zira, are you mad?	Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
We shall want a full autopsy ...	With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Go easy, Stevie.	They look pretty docile.
They look pretty docile.	Yes, but don't take any chances.
What are they doing here?	Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.	I don't believe it.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.	He's a gorilla.
His reactor's starting to overheat.	Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.	Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!	Cuervo, look out behind you!
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.	You told me he was dead.
You told me he was dead.	I thought he was, but he came back.
Give it to me.	You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?	My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.	Somebody get off!
See you in hell, Snake.	If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?	I don't know yet.
I'm already dead.	I see your point. What's the favor?
Dream on, blue eye.	Say goodnight, Carjack.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.	Don't lie to me.
Don't lie to me.	All right, so I made another deal.
All right, so I made another deal.	I got a new deal for you.
I need a favor.	What's in it for me?
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?	Yeah, I got it.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.	It's history. I gotta go.
She's in the green.	Lock fuel rods.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.	By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?	A medical team will be standing by.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?	Having second thoughts?
Shut up, Plissken.	What's the little black box do?
What's the little black box do?	Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's the deal.	Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
Getting ready to invade.	So where's Plissken?
I don't know about this thing.	Don't like it, don't come.
Aw, come on, Snake.	Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.	Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Cease fire with the bullshit.	Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
Where is it?	Right over there.
Where'd they go?	Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
What're you doing in here?	Looking to get out.
Looking to get out.	Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...	Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?	Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.	Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?	Down that way.
What are you gonna do in Venice?	Find Cuervo Jones.
Find Cuervo Jones.	No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
How do we get out of here?	Sewers. Come on.
Don't follow me.	You need help.
You need help.	Like hell I do.
No screamin' shit.	Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Where's the anti-toxin...?	Give me the prototype.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.	Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.	Well, I'll think it over.
Well, I'll think it over.	You're running out of time.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?	Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?	I'm looking for somebody.
When you threw it in, what did you see?	...I saw nothing.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?	It is deep...
But your life and lands are far from here.	I gave up my castles and my lands!
Yield. I have the advantage.	I will not.
He can be no other.	Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...	What is it my child?
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?	Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
Excalibur! Is it true?	The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.	Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.	What's this, what's this?!
In the great book.	What book is that?
You saved me from the arrow...	But not from your destiny.
But not from your destiny.	I want to thank you.
I want to thank you.	That's not why you came.
Who is Merlin?	Speak of the devil!...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.	I recognize you only as my son, no more.
You freed it, son?	I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
I left it in the tent, sir.	Well hurry then, and get it.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.	Don't start a war on my wedding day!
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?	I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Who does it serve?	You, my lord.
The King without his sword, the land without a king...	We are to blame.
Why didn't he kill us?	He has given up.
The law forbids it.	Love demands it.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.	To me? But why?
Very well. Climb up.	I will run.
I will run.	Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.	Twenty days!? The world is that big?
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.	You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.	I am the desert, where water disappears--
You provoke me, Merlin.	What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...	The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
No, no, of course not. You are young...	I'm not jealous!
I'm not jealous!	It's clear you are, and it irks me.
A lovestruck page!	Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?	Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
The oath. You didn't say--	You didn't ask!
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.	Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.	Well what's wrong?
Well what's wrong?	Well why are they tearing the building down?
Well why are they tearing the building down?	Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?	How about Lankaster Merrin.
What's he doing there? Teaching?	No, he's working on another book.
No, he's working on another book.	Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
Where do you want this?	What is it?
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?	Of course I didn't.
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!	I can't believe it.
What did the doctor say?	We have to start looking for a shrink.
What didn't he tell you?	Didn't who tell me?
Maybe the circuit is busy?	Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!	Why don't you let me?
Oh great, anything else?	And you got an invitation.
Oh, she'd love it.	What's her name?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.	Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
No. Not at all,	You were expecting a deliver y that day?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?	Not that I know of.
Not that I know of.	Groceries maybe? A package?
Oh, I see.	Want to ask him?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.	May I ask...?
May I ask...?	We still don't know.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?	No thanks Karl.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?	She is going to be well?
There is nothing.	Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.	Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!	No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Yes, I go now.	Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
No. No rats.	I just heard them Karl.
But it's clean?	All right then we've got clean rats.
Is it coming out Willie?	Yes, I think so.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.	How are you today?
How are you today?	Fine thank you.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?	No. Of course not, nothing like that.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.	Are you sure?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.	What is it? A tranquilizer?
You're kidding! Like what?	Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Why the math?	It affects concentration.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	It's fine really, sit.
Did you know my mother died recently?	Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.	No, is Regan aware of it?
No, is Regan aware of it?	Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?	It's not important good night.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.	I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.	Why, I don't understand?
Why, I don't understand?	To begin with it could make things worse.
Could you see her?	Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-	Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.	You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
About my daughter?	No I didn't know you had one.
No I didn't know you had one.	He didn't mention?
Didn't tell you of what she did?	He didn't mention her.
He didn't mention her.	Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?	I beg your pardon?
I didn't get you?	Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.	Oh yeah, since when?
Please go away.	I'm Father Karras.
So something please Doctor, Help her!	Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
I don't want it.	Honey it's to help you.
Oh my God!	Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
What are you doing here?	My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
People get tired.	Why does God let us get tired?
Why does God let us get tired?	God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?	You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?	But you like him.
Well I heard differently.	Oh you did. What did you hear?
Oh you did. What did you hear?	I don't know, I just thought.
I don't know, I just thought.	Well your thinking's not so good.
Well your thinking's not so good.	How do you know?
How do you know?	Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
I don't know	Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Regan, why are you reading that?	Cause I like it.
Cause I like it.	It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.	I wouldn't talk.
You really don't want me to play huh?	No I do, Captain Howdy said no.

Where'd you get it then?	I stole it.
I stole it.	I believe you.

I came to say goodbye.	You just missed them.
You just missed them.	How's the girl?
How's the girl?	She seemed fine.
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?	Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
You speak Latin?	Ego te abslovo.
Ego te abslovo.	Quod nomen mihi est?
Quod nomen mihi est?	La plume de ma tante.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?	It would bring us together.
It would bring us together.	You and Regan?
You and Regan?	You and us.
You might loosen the straps then.	I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.

In here. With us.	Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?	Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.

Yeah, I know.  Me, too.	I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.	I can keep the beat.
Looks like these got a few years on them.	This'll kill 'em.
I didn't hear you come in.	What're you doing?
Jack, you're on television.	Shut up, Frank.
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?	Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
What's it for?	I don't know. Some disease.
I don't know.	You don't know?

How dare you say you love me.	It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Yeah.  You mind?	Why would I mind?
Unless you want the right.	No, you take the right.
No, you take the right.	We might as well do the towels the same way.

Just a lucky guess.	So what do you think?
Something, huh?  All those bids.	Yeah.  Something.
Yeah.  Something.	Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.	You wanna get a drink?
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.	You're a fucking alarm clock.
You're a fucking alarm clock.	I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
You hit me.	I told you I was gonna hit you.
Get out of here.	Come on, stand still.
Come on, stand still.	Get out of here!

I suppose we can bring it down a little.	I'll drop the eighths.
What's the matter?	I didn't get her number.
You're getting cold feet about this.	I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Let's get it over with.	All right.  What's your name?

Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?	I don't know what you mean.
I don't know what you mean.	The hell you don't.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.	It wasn't like that.
Your doorbell doesn't work.	Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack.
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.	It's not family.  It's business.
It's not family.  It's business.	So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.

Funny.  Strike a bell?	It's only a ring.  Not a collar.

Trust me, you're not missing anything.	You look awful.
Really.  You sleeping?	Only on odd days.
Only on odd days.	Seeing anyone in particular?
Seeing anyone in particular?	Why the interest?

You're their uncle.	Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.	They don't.  They're always asking about you.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.	They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.	It was an accident.
It was an accident.	It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.	You got weird kids, Frank.
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.	Like an angel.
Don't make trouble, all right?	Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!

Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.	How we doing?
How we doing?	How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?	Am I late?
Am I late?	That's not the point.
That's not the point.	What's the point?
Spur of the moment.	So what'd you think?
So what'd you think?	Thrilling.  Both of you.
Thrilling.  Both of you.	The audience was a little off tonight.
No, no.  You boys are tired.	No, we're not.  Jack?
Yes, it is.	Well ... thanks.  Bye.
Uh... he knows it.	Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.

Susie.  Susie Diamond.	Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.	What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
You're an hour and a half late.	So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?	We ran long.
We ran long.	So run a little longer.
Don't take it personally.	How should I take it?
You're an hour and a half late.	My watch is broken, too.
My watch is broken, too.	Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
This where the auditions are?	This is where the auditions were.
This is where the auditions were.	What do you mean?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!	You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Got another song for us?	Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.	Well then ... shall we?
What's with you two?	Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Hey, will you look at that?	They must've bought the same map we did.
They must've bought the same map we did.	What do you say we send a bottle over?
What do you say we send a bottle over?	I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
You're kidding me.	As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Smells like tuna number two to me.	It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
You two could play checkers.	Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.	Sorry.  It only plays static.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.	So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
Maybe it's legit.	Maybe.  I'll call him.
I said I was sorry.	Did you hear it?
The switch.  Hit the switch.	Switch?  What fucking switch?
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.	You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.	You're a prince.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.	Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
I wear a seven.	Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?	Save it for your wife.
Come on.  We don't have much time.	Time for what?
Where's your dress?	What's he talking about?
Do I look like I'm naked?	That!  You can't wear that!
That!  You can't wear that!	What's wrong with it?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?	No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.	What I mean is --
What I mean is --	We're a team.  We work together.
We're a team.  We work together.	So work with me, not against me. Okay?
When we know.	Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.	Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.	I sing now?
I sing now?	That's the premise.
Yes, well, they are.	Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.	They are in tune.  But not with each other.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.	Is that important?
Is that important?	Uh, well ...
He doesn't bite.	They never do, Mr. Barker.
Barker.  Jock Barker?	Baker.  Jack Baker.
Baker.  Jack Baker.	Right.  Bring him back.
Right.  Bring him back.	Come on, Ed.
Don't worry about it.	You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
All right.  Hold on.	The name's Baker --
The name's Baker --	Save it.  What's he look like?
Save it.  What's he look like?	Black.  Labrador.
You miss him, don't you?	It's been a long time, Ma.
It went well tonight.	Frank works hard.
Frank works hard.	And you don't?
And you don't?	He leads, I follow.
He leads, I follow.	Is that the way it is?
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.	If I see him.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?	Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.	So ... ?
So ... ?	We outgrew each other.
So how's the cat food business?	Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
You can always get another girl.	There's always another girl.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.	If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Look, if you want to leave...	Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
Frank said ---	Frank wasn't 'there.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...	Ma didn't want it around.  After.
He had a mind that escalated things.	So, what happened?
The both of them?  In there?	He called her.
He called her.	Oh. So what's it doing here?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?	Ed? How many people live here?
I'm not upset.	All I said was you were good.
All I said was you were good.	Look. You don't know good. All right?
Look. You don't know good. All right?	What's that supposed to mean?
You were good.	Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.	You were good.
You were good.	How do you know?
I can keep the beat.	Better than that.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.	Guess I got a little scattered.
Guess I got a little scattered.	It's a shitty  song.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.	Just dinner and dance, right?
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.	Hey, business is business.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.	No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Like a baby. You?	In and out.
So why's he do it?	I guess in case one year they're not.
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.	Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
You never sang before?	Not for money. With my mother.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?	He'll come around.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.	Another five years, huh?
Another five years, huh?	Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.	It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?	He's got blood in his eye.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?	Losing his teeth.
How'd the show go?	Okay.  How'd yours go?
Okay.  How'd yours go?	Not so good.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?	What's a prom?
What's a prom?	Ever go to church?
Is that what you used to do?	My days are not the old days, genius.
My days are not the old days, genius.	What are they?
What are they?	The recent past.
The recent past.	Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.	How do you know?
How do you know?	I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
I guess it's getting serious.	Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Guess they're up.	Sounds big.  What's he do?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?	He's losing his teeth.
Big piece or little?	Huh? Oh, no.
So. How are you?	Fine.  You?
John.  It's good to see you.	Good to see you, Ma.
What did he do?	He hit a guard.
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?	"Not unless you're sent to the ""Clinic."""
"Not unless you're sent to the ""Clinic."""	You mean if I get sick?
Fine work, Jon.	Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.	"I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say ""thanks""?"
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.	Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.	Yeah -- me.
Or reactivated the first one.	Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
For being one helluva guy.	"""Thanks?""  I guess they really did fuck you up."
That's not the worst part.	What's worse than losing five million bucks?
And I bet I've kept that promise ...	Only one you've never broken.
How is he?	No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.	That's what they always say.
What do you mean?	He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
I took it from my fake husband.	Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.	I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.	What more proof do you need?
Whoever you are, don't call again.	Don't hang up ...
Must've been after we got engaged.	Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.	So you had a nightmare.
We need to talk.	I'm late for surgery.
"How is the ""date night"" idea going over with Eve?"	Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.	Not if I kill you first ...
What -- what are you doing?	Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --	Or what?  You'll have me fired?
They're too tight.	So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
You mean like ... condoms?	I mean like protection.
Clarissa left those here.	I won't tell mom if you don't.
I won't tell mom if you don't.	When did you start smoking?
You've got someone in your office.	Get rid of them.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...	Well, I saw you -- Kim.
That's your name, isn't it?	You always call me Miss Brewster.
Commander, what are you doing here?	Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
I'm just having some fun.	There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Back then -- who wasn't?	Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
I'll deal with her later.	Good.  Because I'm fed up.
Oh, that Karl.	Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.	The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.	Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
You're wearing your suit --	Call me spontaneous.
I'm not going anywhere.	You always say that -- then you leave.
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.	Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?	They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
What is with you tonight?	Don't I usually kiss my wife?
"What happened to your big ""assignment""?"	What do you know about it?
What do you know about it?	As much as ever.  Nothing.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.	I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Oh, and Oxxford called...	Ooh, my suits are ready...
Jack, are you okay?	Whats going on here?
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.	I dont think youre hearing me.
Take you, for instance...	What about me?
And I know people.	Im sure you do...
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.	A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?	Thats right. And auto supply...
Thats right. And auto supply...	Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
You have kids, Jack?	Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?	I don't know.  Maybe...
Were almost done here...	Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Is it morning yet?	No, honey. Go back to sleep.
What are you doing?	Ringing my bell...
Very nice. What is it?	Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.	Ah. A classic...
One year he had a solar system named after her...	Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?	Mom liked it.
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?	Thats where you work.
Do you like kids?	On a case by case basis...
On a case by case basis...	You know how to make chocolate milk?
You know how to make chocolate milk?	I think I could figure it out.
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...	Wheres my real dad?
Wheres my real dad?	I dont know...
Hey, you cant park that thing here.	Its me, Jack...
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...	Howd you know my name?
Howd you know my name?	We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.	I never won anything in bowling.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.	She is relentless.
She is relentless.	She wants to have an affair with me.
She wants to have an affair with me.	She said that?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?	So could you write down her exact address?
Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.	Screw the rules.  Im talking about the choice.
You see, its like were in each others heads...	Kates my wife...
Trouble at work?	I dont think so.
I dont think so.	Its not Kate, is it?
Got a minute, Jack?	Ive got all the time in the world...
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.	How much time?!
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...	What the hell is happening to me?!
Miss me, Jack?	Thats my car!  You stole my car!
You still think this is about me, don't you?	Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
You just said everyone needs something.	I've got everything I need.
How'd you know my name was Jack?	"I call all you white guys ""Jack."""
Like I said, it's a business deal...	Damn, you are the real thing...
What!?  Look at the ticket...!	Get out, I call 911.
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.	What're you talkin' about?
What're you talkin' about?	You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
Are we finally being honest?	It would help me if we were.
It would help me if we were.	Okay, youre right, weve been dancing around this for years...
Are we what, Jack?	Is there something going on between us?
Something like that.	Need a nurse?
Need a nurse?	Youre a nurse?
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...	Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Merry Christmas to you, sir...	Thanks.  To you too...
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...	If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
No, I didnt...thats great.	Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?	Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.	Howd you do this year, Tony?
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...	We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
To Paris. Paris, France.	Thats the one...
Thats the one...	So youre not at a non- profit firm?
So youre not at a non- profit firm?	Not with what they pay me...
Not with what they pay me...	Youre not married, are you?
Youre not married, are you?	No, Jack, I never got married. You?
You look great.	Its good to see you...
I promise, Jack...	Promise me again...
Promise me again...	I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Its been interesting, thats for sure.	But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
This place is a perk, Kate.	A perk for what?
Pretty incredible, isnt it?	Its like a museum.
I could stay here forever...	I dont think Id fight you on that one...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...	Thats all I wanted to hear...
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.	I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...	I guess...some of them are probably faking.
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.	But Im gettin close, right?
You really are incredible...	Enjoy it, sweetheart...
Maybe I should wait...	No, open it...
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.	What? You make me hot...
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...	Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...	Then say it...just say it to me...!
You want the cake!?	I want it...
Our life in a nutshell...	If you want to look at it that way...
If you want to look at it that way...	How would you look at it?
I think it worked out okay, dont you?	Sure.  I really like Annie.
Sure.  I really like Annie.	Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?	She got those shoes...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...	This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?	That is the general idea, yes...
Here you go...	Youre kidding me...
Youre kidding me...	Shes your dog, Jack.
Shes your dog, Jack.	No, shes not.
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?	Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
Where were you?	I was in the city.
I was in the city.	The city?  New York City?  Why?
The city?  New York City?  Why?	Because thats where I live.
Because thats where I live.	Jack...dont even start...
What kind of man does that!?	I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
I can't seem to let go of you...	You hear me complaining about that?
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...	No, youre right.  What are we doing?
No, youre right.  What are we doing?	We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
Dont  go, Jack...	You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
All in one tape?	I also put side two of London Calling on there...
For one thing, you like expensive things.	Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
He certainly has your number, Alan.	Youre a little tougher, Peter.
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?	Not by a long shot.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.	Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?	I need you, tiger..
I need you, tiger..	Where is he?
Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?	Im sorry, no...
Can I help you?	Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Don't you have anywhere to go?	I've got plenty of places to go.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?	I'm taking the train...
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.	So we'll get egg nog.
I want to see you again.	I'd like that, too.
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?	Of course I did.
Of course I did.	Last night was great...
We're going to have to work on your touch.	I like the sound of that.
I'm not really dressed for a party.	Relax, it's casual.
Relax, it's casual.	No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
How'd you know it was me?	I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
I don't think She's real big on hate.	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
We're working as hard as we can --	Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.	Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --	O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
We had a tough year.	Yeah, nine years straight.
What the --!	Ben.  Are you okay?
Ben.  Are you okay?	Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
Are you alright?	I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?	He's smart, powerful, successful --
He's smart, powerful, successful --	Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --	Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.	I should have done more, run more tests --
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.	Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?	He's made a few changes.
I had it at four.	This makes five.
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.	I'm sure he's matured since then.
What about his first born?	Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
I can't take this.	Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.	You'd never know it.
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!	Go back to the drawing board.
Where...where am I?	Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.	Reed? ... Sue?
Reed? ... Sue?	They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
'Course not.  Strictly business.	Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.	Don't you wander off, boy.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.	Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it.  Everything I want.
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?	Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
Ben, come in.	What is this?  Where's Reed?
What is this?  Where's Reed?	Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
What are <u>you</u> doing here?	I'm worried about you.
I'm worried about you.	About me?  How sweet.
<u>Where is Reed</u>?	Victor must've taken him.
Oh, he did.	<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
You look like an eighties rock band.	The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...	That's terrible news...
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.	But all these people...
Back it down, Johnny!	I can go hotter!
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.	Oh, it is.
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!	Ben, are you there?
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.	Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
He's not responsive --	Ben!  Ben!
You're on fire!	Not this again --
Not this again --	No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
Stay right.  Left is trouble.	I though we went over this.
I though we went over this.	Last one down springs for room service.
So are you!	I mean, you feel a little feverish.
What are you doing --	Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.	But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --	No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
You two need a time-out.	Blockhead started it!
What is that <i>thing</i>?	I think that thing is Ben.
Apparently I can disappear.	<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."	And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
Leonard, how's the feed?	Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Ben did this.	<u>Ben</u> did this?
Come on, Ben, come on...	Reed, we're running out of time.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?	Not at all.
I found a broken gasket, from space --	A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --	I'm sure I can come up with something.
I can...make it work.	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --	The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --	You <u>need</u> a doctor.
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?	No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?	Of course.  Of course.
And reverse the mutations --	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?	Are you kidding?
That's what we're here to find out.	If it happened to him, then it could...
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.	What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.	What?  What do you mean you --
What?  What do you mean you --	Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
Please don't make this personal --	Oh, I think you already have.
Oh, I think you already have.	Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
Victor, I'm sorry I --	Just <u>find</u> him.
What's going on?	Victor, are you feeling alright?
What are you doing?	Raising the shields.
Raising the shields.	You can't leave them out there.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?	I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?	I'd hold that off awhile.
I'd hold that off awhile.	Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
I told you to cut down on the sugar.	I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.	Message to Proteus.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...	What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?	Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
The less time, the better.	I know that. But what's the maximum?
Can't remember?... What do you mean?	He's blanked out on that one particular point.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.	Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
And take a little trip with them...	Trip? Where to?
You mean <I'm> going along?	As part of the Crew.
As part of the Crew.	Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!	Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.	But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !	It's only for an hour --
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.	Say that again?
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?	No question of her loyalty.
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.	Here's the Surgeon.
Benes... What the devil happened?	The Other Side got to him.
The Other Side got to him.	How bad off is he?
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]	I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --	Difficult? He's impossible!
Difficult? He's impossible!	That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.	They're much smaller than bacteria...
What is it?  Anything wrong?	I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.	Thank you for volunteering.
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.	What do you mean?
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...	What gives you that idea?
Thank you for saving my life.	That's what they pay me for.
That's what they pay me for.	A great deal more than that, I believe...
No need to get up --	I feel much better now...
Open it! Open it before they get here!	I can't till the hatch is flooded!
No, it requires such absolute precision --	A surgeon might...
Shouldn't you answer that?	Not now. We need air, not greetings!
Then how come it worked loose?	I have no idea.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.	But I did. I'm positive!
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.	I always thought it was nothing but red.
A long time, with one man.	Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.	Now I know...
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?	We're pushing oxygen today.
We're pushing oxygen today.	I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.	You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.	Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...	You may learn to like it.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --	You left something out.
I've done all I could with the laser.	All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
What can we do?	Nothing -- against all that force.
Doctor, what's wrong?	I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!	It's too late now. We must go on.
You said there was a quick way out!	What about Dr. Michaels?

Tell me more. I want to know everything.	There isn't any more to tell.
There isn't any more to tell.	Don't say that.
Well, it's enough for me.	You don't have to say that.
You don't have to say that.	I never say anything I have to.
What do you do - for a living I mean?	Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.	Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...

You're the pathetic one, not me.	I'm going on over there...
I'm going on over there...	I'm not some piece a crap.
I'm not some piece a crap.	I know you're not.
I know you're not.	You treat me like I was.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.	I hope they do.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...	I did, didn' I, El?
I did, didn' I, El?	You got another ball comin'.
You can sing the song.	You know what, you are never satisfied.
You know what, you are never satisfied.	That's right, hand.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?	I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
You're not going to play it again.	Well, lemme play the other side then.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.	Where are you going?
You want me to hold the chicken.	Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?	No. We have tomatoes.
No. We have tomatoes.	But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Can I get you anything else?	No. How much do I owe you?
No. How much do I owe you?	Five'll do it.
Wasn't it, ladies?	Are you talking to us?
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...	You were going without saying goodbye?
You were going without saying goodbye?	I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.	But what about me?
But what about me?	I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
I'm talking to you, Tita!	Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?	Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
I think he's got a terrific personality.	You know, he was formerly a sailor.
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.	Yeah, well, he's...
Look at that.	Why are you being so mean?
Why are you being so mean?	I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?	No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Uhm hmm. Some range.	It's not that bad.
How long have you been staying here?	A couple of months.
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...	Yeah, me, too...
Yeah... I guess so...	I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Daddy's very ill.	Oh, well, what, what's he...
Oh, well, what, what's he...	He's had two strokes.
I have to talk seriously with you...	Everybody still up on the Island?
Who's Van Oost?	Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.	Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
You always do this to me.	Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.	Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
That'll make you happy.	I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...	Just give me a chance, will you?
No, I can't...	Will you let me talk to you, please?
Oh. You have to tell me that.	What?! I can't hear you!
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...	Yes, it is!
I have to talk to you.	I'll be back later...
That's what you said?	Something witty and devastating like that.
Serious, that's what's important to you?	Yes, that's what's important to me...
I don't find your language that charming.	It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.	I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...	Some bath oil?
You think I'm a fake.	I think it's what you think.
I think it's what you think.	No, it isn't what I think.
I didn't have any.	You had no inner feeling?
You don't call that music, though.	Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.	The day after tomorrow.
The day after tomorrow.	If you're free.
If you're free.	Yeah, I'll probably be free.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.	That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?	I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Robert, I think you better just...	You're all full of shit!
Oh, for chrissakes...	Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
That's three games to none, Carl.	All right, let's have a rematch.
I'm not aware of it. Like what?	Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
Four or five years.	No, the last time was three years ago.
What kind of doggy is that?	It's a Borzoi.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...	I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.	I hope I didn't hear that.
I don't think that's true.	It is true.
It is true.	Besides being very rude.
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.	Well, I should hope not...
"Don't call me ""honey,"" mack."	"Don't call me ""mack,"" honey."
You better hold onto your tongue!	Hold onto this.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!	Jesus, what a rude person...
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.	I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?	If you want to call it that.
If you want to call it that.	Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.	That's exactly what I am doing, again.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.	Oh, for pity's sake...
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.	Is it true?
Then don't go out with me.	"For once in your life have some 
"For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'."
Why you have an attitude for?	Not now, I'm busy

So what do you want with her anyway?	I'm a good friend of hers.
I'm a good friend of hers.	How do I know you're not lying.
My friend told me she lived around here.	Your friend must be misinformed.
Your friend must be misinformed.	Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
God I admire you.	By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.	You mean her.
Hey you're really nuts.	They didn't do anything.
They didn't do anything.	What? What are you talking about?
What? What are you talking about?	I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Hey, what are you doing?	Fletch, this is dumb.
Fletch, this is dumb.	You don't have to run with me, Crease.
That's what he said.	He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?	I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Wonder who his supplier is.	I have no idea.
I have no idea.	I wasn't asking.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.	I ought to get some sleep.
I ought to get some sleep.	Creasy, how old are you?
This one's going to be even more fun.	Go ahead. Make my evening.
Thanks for coming down to see us.	Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Not a prayer.	That a boy.
What the hell are you doing here?	Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Funny old bird.	Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Is she ever. I've got some stories....	I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.	It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.	Oh, he was dying for years.
Oh, he was dying for years.	Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.	He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
So where do you know Alan from?	We play tennis at the club.
We play tennis at the club.	Really. The California Racquet Club?
I'm serious, Sam.	What, the heat here?
You don't have a piece of the action?	Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
You find the source?	Gum thought Brazil.
No idea at all?	Okay. Some idea.
I guess not.	He'll be so relieved.
Are you all right, Doctor?	Where am I?
Where am I?	You're in the Records Room.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.	You may be right.
You may be right.	Are you serious?
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.	Until she remarries, Fletch.
Until she remarries, Fletch.	Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
You should have proved that in a court of law.	My lawyer was a bum.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.	Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.	'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'
Read this, please.	Wait a second --
Wait a second --	Cut the crap and read it.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.	Of course they are.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?	Then he has.
Then he has.	Course he has. That's his wife.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?	Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Isn't that nice. Since when?	Since he moved to L.A.
Ten days ago?	That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.	Harry S. Truman?
Harry S. Truman?	My parents were great fans of the former President.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.	What are you doing here?
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?	You sure did.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?	I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.	Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?	Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Sure you did.	Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.	Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?	Its okay. The cops did it.
They busted me last week.	They bust you every week.
They bust you every week.	I know. I got bad luck or something.
Where am I going?	Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.	They serve dinner on the flight?
Do you have a passport?	Sure, all drifters do.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?	What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.	Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.	I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?	Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.	I have the same problem with my help.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.	In this drawer....
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.	I'm all ears.
I'm all ears.	I want you to murder me.
Because we can't.	Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'	I wonder if that's his doctor.
I wonder if that's his doctor.	Only one way to find out.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'	Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Not our kind of people, you understand.	Spot right here.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.	No problem, boss.
Can I steal you for a minute?	Only if you promise not to return me.
'Magic' today, huh?	Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
No, thank you.	How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
She's cute as a button.	How long have they been married?
His bride. Cute as a button.	You've met her?
Don't worry, I can take it.	You shouldn't be here.
You shouldn't be here.	I want to hear this.
I'm calling the police. Right now.	You can't do that.
You can't do that.	Don't tell me I can't --
Don't tell me I can't --	They're trying to kill me!
What is this....	I checked. There was no divorce.
I checked. There was no divorce.	Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???	I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
I think you better sit down.	Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...	I'll take you to a game.
I'll take you to a game.	What are you talking about?
What does all this mean?	Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.	But I've seen the deed.
But I've seen the deed.	You saw a forgery.
What are you talking about?	That's what I want to know.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.	I think you should call me Gail, now.
Thanks for the great time.	What is this?
Just like Alan. It's freaky.	Can I ask you a question?
Can I ask you a question?	Depends on the question.
Depends on the question.	Are you still in love with Alan?
What about his parents?	He never sees them and I never met them.
All this goes on Underhill's bill?	I saved his life during the war.
I saved his life during the war.	You were in the war?
You were in the war?	No. He was. I got him out.
I mean put clothes on.	Here, take mine.
I ordered lunch.	You ordered it here?
You ordered it here?	Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.	Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
Who is it?	It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
I have this effect on lots of women.	I bet you do.
You are a rich woman.	See what I mean?
Why do you keep doing this?	I love the outfits.
Preoccupied with what?	Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
That's a strange combination.	So were my parents.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.	John! You used to fly together!
You want I set up?	No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?	In her cabana, sir.
I would, actually.	Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Charged to the Underhills, sir?	Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?	Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.	I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?	I recommend it.
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?	Yes, I'm with the Underhills.

What did you do with Rennie??	Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
I doubt very much that one even exists.	What are you talking about?
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!	Walking corpses are not real!
I demand to know what is going on...	Oh dear God...
I thought I told you to stay away from her.	Where is she?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.	Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
You're telling a lie.	Am I? Let's find out.
What a beautiful day.	Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.	This isn't a request.
You had me worried to death!	But Sean said...
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...	She didn't push me into coming.
She didn't push me into coming.	Why are you doing this to yourself?
It's not that simple.	Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
I can't swim.	I gathered that.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.	Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
I've got the numbers.	Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.	What is your location?
What is your location?	I...I don't know...
I...I don't know...	Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Rennie...what'd they do to you??	Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
I didn't mean for you to go!	Just radio for help, okay???
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...	What do you mean???
It's okay...you're going to be okay.	I want to go home. I want off this ship.
I got you a present.	But I didn't get you one...
But I didn't get you one...	Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
I heard you weren't coming.	We changed our minds.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.	That's where I peed.
We must abandon.	Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.	Do not inhale.
We must abandon.	What do you mean, we must abandon?
What do you mean, we must abandon?	Ruptured steam pipe.
I opened thousands of brains.	What did you find?
What did you find?	Big mess every time.
I used to drive a taxi.	Where you're going, mister?
Guys ready to order?	Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.	How do you Eknow.
Had to be him.	She was very evasive.
It's your best play, Nicky.	He'll hate it.
We're making too much of this.	No, we're not.
Where is it?	I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.	That was a big mistake.
He carries a gun.	Then you should carry a gun.
Where are you going?	Don't wait Efor me.
Don't wait Efor me.	What about the haircut?
Is it safe?	Do we care?
Do we care?	I think we Nought to wait.
I think we Nought to wait.	I say we go.
I say we go.	You say we go?
You say we go?	Do not inhale.
Do not inhale.	I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.	Here we go.
What was it like?	I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.	Tonight. What's tonight?
Tonight. What's tonight?	Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.	You mean because What's-His-Name.
It's just a review.	It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.	What's the fuss? I don't get it.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.	That's what I said eighteen months ago.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.	What happened eighteen months ago?
And he was there?	Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.	A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
We must abandon.	Do not inhale.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.	She wants a divorce.
She wants a divorce.	Don't talk like that.
Don't talk like that.	It's over, finished and done with.
It's over, finished and done with.	That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?	I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.	But didn't we know it would happen?
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.	Press a button and they give us money.
Press a button and they give us money.	Ride with me. We need a haircut.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.	Shut up, Elliot.
Of course I saw it.	Did you see the winning run score?
Did you see the winning run score?	You're not making sense. Make sense.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	What are we talking about?
What are we talking about?	Yes. What are you implying?
This could be it.	This could be it.
This could be it.	This could be it.
This could be it.	This could be it.
This could be it.	Does it feel comfortable?
Does it feel comfortable?	Does what feel comfortable?
Does what feel comfortable?	This could be it.
This could be it.	This could be it.
This could Pbe it.	This could be it.
This could be it.	This could be it.
This could be it.	Let's work on it.
Let's work on it.	Let's work on it.
It's your best play, Nicky.	They'll lose because they're my team.
They'll lose because they're my team.	He will absolutely hate it.
This is how we've managed to last.	We're able to surprise each other.
We're able to surprise each other.	In and out of bed.
In and out of bed.	Because we're completely mismatched.
Because we're completely mismatched.	We don't even like each other, do we?
You know about Adele.	What about her?
I talked to her two days ago.	Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?	There's nothing left for me to lie about.
I have a class. I'm late.	Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?	I'm not sure.
Take it yourself. Take a date.	I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.	Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?	Why do you need a radio?
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?	I go to college. I thought you knew.
I go to college. I thought you knew.	Do you want to get some coffee?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.	It's your best play, Nicky.
Why won't you tell me your name?	It's only our first date.
I am really, deeply sorry.	It violates so many trusts.
It violates so many trusts.	It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
Opening night, Lillian.	Who the hell cares?
That's always been my problem.	And you've been extremely patient.
I'd forgotten that.	I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.	That's very lovely actually.
Be open with me. I'd like that.	There may be things you'd rather not know about.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?	I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.	She's my gynecologist.
Your father said you might be here.	Two-all after six.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.	All right. What's been going on?
All right. What's been going on?	I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
Life is true.	Life is real.
This could be it!	This could be it!
What did it say?	A thousand things.
A thousand things.	You're hurting my head.
People are dependable.	I don't know if I can say that.
Life is good.	Life is good.
Great game. Red Sox are winning.	They're always winning. Until they lose.
So what are you going to do about it?	What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?	Show him who we are.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.	Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Since when did that matter?	Let's not start that again.
Let's not start that again.	My back is killing me.
My back is killing me.	Where's your elastic brace?
Where's your elastic brace?	I can't find it.
What do you want?	It's me. Nicky.
It's me. Nicky.	Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.	Where are your glasses? Go get them.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.	If it's you, what are you doing here?
If it's you, what are you doing here?	I'm on my way to get a haircut.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.	Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Who is it?	I'm at the door.
I'm at the door.	Go way. I'll call a cop.
Go way. I'll call a cop.	Pop, will you let me in?
Pop, will you let me in?	Where the hell are you?
Where the hell are you?	Right here. At the door.
This could be it!	This could be it!
Don't worry. It's a test.	It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Because life is good.	Because faith is rewarded.
Then say it.	Life is good.
Life is good.	Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
It's a complicated subject.	It's a simple subject.
You see what you're doing, don't you?	What am I doing?
What am I doing?	You're charming the boy.
You're charming the boy.	Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.	Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.	How come you got the kid with you?
How come you got the kid with you?	Matthew's my grandson.
Matthew's my grandson.	A grandmother. God bless you.
It's the kid's lucky day.	This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.	Now that's a complicated subject.
Now that's a complicated subject.	That's a simple subject.
Everybody else does. Why not you?	You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Then they lost?	Why does it matter?
Why does it matter?	If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.	Why do you care?
Why do you care?	They're my team.
They're my team.	No. They're not your team. They're my team.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.	You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
Game six is history,pal.	You're not making sense.
Have to hurry back.	Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?	Eleventh inning. What else?
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.	I was educated by nuns.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.	I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
What? Come on, Paisley.	Our Steven not only disguises himself.
Do you think he can do it?	I don't know.
I don't know.	He's a very sweet man.
He's a very sweet man.	Where are you going now?
Someone waiting for you?	No one's waiting.
I hear good things about the new play.	So do I. Over and over.
So do I. Over and over.	Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.	Would you like to meet him?
Would you like to meet him?	He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
The fact is, I have to get going.	Is it true?
Is it true?	Is what true?
Is what true?	He wears a disguise.
You've worked with Elliot?	I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?	There was a review.
There was a review.	I think I remember.
I think I remember.	So does Elliot.
So does Elliot.	Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.	Oh. You know him.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.	A little drastic maybe?
A little drastic maybe?	Say it again.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.	I'm going home to my machine.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.	I don't want you, Steven.
I haven't come to you.	But you're here. So you must have come to me.
Please! You're being foolish!	There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Everyone takes his turn.	It is the work of untouchables.
I am your wife.	All the more reason.
Are you sure?	Yes -- I can't talk like this.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.	They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Just an admirer...	Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?	No. That is what you get for distracting me.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.	What do you expect when you talk like that?
"They're calling you ""Bapu."" I thought it meant father."	It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
What are you doing?	Going nearer to God!
That was lucky.	I thought you were a man of God.
What'd he say?	He said he's in charge...
You mean Gandhi?	Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.	What was he like?
I'll take your luggage back, baas.	No, no -- just a moment, please.
It was one incident.	Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
What can we do?	We must end the campaign.
Do you remember much of South Africa?	A great deal.
Hm.  Is it?	Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
You're an ambitious man.	I hope not.
"I don't know... I'm still searching for a ""response."""	You will respect the law.
You will respect the law.	There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
I would rather march.	First spin. Let the others march for a time.
We need your help!	There is nothing I can give.
The fools!  Sorry...	It's split the Government.
It's split the Government.	Well, that's one victory.
In England, I was a poor student but I --	That was England.
All right. Fine.	I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.	Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.	Somehow I expected not.
Perhaps some tea?	I dined at the prison.
Will you have a glass of sherry?	Thank you. No.
Could we cut all news off? I know --	Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
Have you read his magazine?	No -- but I think I'm going to.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.	Who are you trying to convince?
How much extra?	It would be five thousand more.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.	I'll take care of it.
Not yet, I'm afraid.	No?  What's keeping you?
No?  What's keeping you?	I guess I'm a slow learner.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.	Where did you get this?
What are you waiting for?	Where do we start?
Where do we start?	We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
That's the last.	Something's not right.
Something's not right.	He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.	No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.	We don't have the manpower.
We don't have the manpower.	Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.	From what budget?
Don't underestimate these imposters.	None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.	This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
Twelve have a mission within the week.	This time I will supervise each test personally.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?	Thank you, no.
We believe we have a suspect.	What a relief.
What a relief.	This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
What's wrong with him?	You have more in common than you know.
Good to see you're feeling better.	"Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your ""friends""?"
"Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your ""friends""?"	It's about the Director.
You okay, Jerome?	Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
Why have you done this?	In case you get back before I do.
In case you get back before I do.	Where are you going?
Where are you going?	I'm travelling too.
How are you, Jerome?	Not bad, Jerome.
Not bad, Jerome.	How the hell did you get here.
How the hell did you get here.	I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
How would you like to be yourself for the day?	I was never very good at it, remember?
Everybody goes there.	You may as well invite her here.
You may as well invite her here.	Will you be okay?
Where are we going?	I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
How was your evening?	Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?	Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Is that all?	I've got enough on my mind without that.
I've got enough on my mind without that.	If you say so.  The stripe.
You really had other offers?	I'm sure I could have.
What makes them think that?	They found my eyelash.
Any particular reason?	We can't stay here.
We can't stay here.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	They think I offed the Director.
It's all right.	I'm proud of you, Vincent.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.	It's okay, Eugene.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.	You know I'm scared of heights.
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.	How long do you stay up there before you go?
How long do you stay up there before you go?	A day or so.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!	Keep going!!  Keep going!!
Let's get out of here.	You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
He was still warm when they confirmed.	This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?	The place is crawling with Hoovers.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.	So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
You really need that much?	<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.	God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
It needs work.	You had to be a right-hander.
You had to be a right-hander.	Noone orders southpaws anymore.
What will happen to the others?	"They are not babies, Maria, merely ""human possibilities""."
You can wear lifts.	Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.	There's a way.
German, is that you?	Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
Hugo!  I've found him!	I've found him too.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.	You worried about the cost?
A year is a long time.	Not so long--just once around the sun.
--when you go away.	We could go together one day.
What is it?	I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
My medication.  I left it back there.	We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
Who are they?	It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
Why are we leaving?	Those checks take forever.
What <i>is</i> this place?	You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
So you didn't do it after all.	I guess somebody beat me to it.
I envy you, Jerome.	You'll be next.
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.	You celebrate, Jerome?
It was a mercy-killing after all.	They found an eyelash.
In the South Wing.	Does it have a name?
Does it have a name?	Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.	We were just looking.
We were just looking.	I know about you.
I was at home.	Were <i>you</i> alone?
Why don't we say we were together?	Why would we do that?
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?	No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Flight got you nervous?	There's a problem, Lamar.
The doctor will give you something.	I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.	Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
What are you doing?	I can't do this.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.	They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.	That's your problem.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.	And you got him...
They will be ready. You guys do your job.	I'll take care of my end.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...	I heard about you. You work with Miller.
You gotta be kidding.	Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.	Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.	I guess we are.
Where do we go from here?	I don't know, airport I guess.
Come on, come on.	Who was it?
Who was it?	Just get your clothes on...
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.	Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.	Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.	Oh, Jesus... how?
I don't know.	Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.	Whatever you say.
You and me.	Can we make it?
Can we make it?	We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
You want to try with me?	Things can't get much worse can they?
Things can't get much worse can they?	I don't see how.
No more about Beynon.	Whatever happens it's over.
I want to say something.	I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.	Listen to me. It's hard enough.
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.	It's all a game, don't bother me.
Only one car.	Let's do it.
That would be the first time.	When are you going to learn?
When are you going to learn?	I did I killed a man.
You're full of ifs.	I think you liked it with him.
There may be a hunting party.	Why, there's nothing on the news?
Why, there's nothing on the news?	I didn't mean police.
You've got it all figured.	No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Do you mean that?	I mean it.
Texas is a big state.	I can handle it.
I can handle it.	I'll bet you can.
A man helped me open it...	And switched keys.
And switched keys.	He must have.
He must have.	It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Why didn't you tell me?	There wasn't any way to explain it.
She's on TV.	If you don't start telling the truth...
If you don't start telling the truth...	What do we do?
What do we do?	We keep going.
I don't want to go there.	Do it my way.
He might be ready to chop us up.	Do it my way.
What about the bank?	Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
Promise you won't laugh.	If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
You know how I feel?	My mind's not on guessing games.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...	Usually on the right side as you go in.
That doesn't hurt.	But sometimes I cried a lot too.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.	I didn't. I just waited.
I didn't. I just waited.	Want to cry now?
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.	I couldn't have... much longer.
I couldn't have... much longer.	Yeah... I know.
$250,000 right off the top.	Is he straight?
Is he straight?	You got the parole, didn't you?
I was going to fix you breakfast.	You were asleep.
You were asleep.	I bought you a lot of new things.
How was it?	Better than I remembered.
I'll be okay.	Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
I guess I'm kind of...	It's all right.
It's all right.	It's just been a while.
You go out much?	After four years and now the question comes up.
After four years and now the question comes up.	Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.	I'm still here, Doc.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.	That's not all of it.
That's not all of it.	No. It's been a long time.
How does it taste?	Just the way I remembered.
Half a million.	That Beynon's got a long arm.
That Beynon's got a long arm.	What do you want for dinner?
What do you want for dinner?	Whisky and a peach.
Where did you get those?	I've been doing my homework.
I've been doing my homework.	Just like old times?
Just like old times?	Better than old times.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.	Where did you get them developed?
Where did you get them developed?	Assumed name... Houston.
What's Beynon got set up?	Small town, small bank, big money.
It doesn't look like that.	What do you mean? You've never been there.
What do you mean? You've never been there.	I've been there every day for the last four years.
Where do you want to go?	I want to take a walk.
You want to drive?	My license expired, let's get out of here.
We'll try again.	No way. I've got to get out now.
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.	I really hope you have a nice trip.
I really hope you have a nice trip.	Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
No, I'm afraid not.	I never have any luck.
That certainly makes you kind of special...	Yeah... I guess it does.
Hope you get to where you're going.	Thanks. Hope you do too.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.	Oh my God.
All right. Shells?	Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.	Gonna knock down a wall?
Gonna knock down a wall?	Might try that.
Aren't we going a little hard?	What do you have in mind?
Wire pull over?	One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.	I'm good at that.
You were with him?	Yeah. I got out.
Yeah. I got out.	What about you?
He took the day off.	Then you do it.
Then you do it.	Can't leave the desk.
Listen... how much money did you make this year?	What's it to you?
What's it to you?	Come on. How much?
Come on. How much?	'Bout five thousand.
'Bout five thousand.	How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
And I keep my mouth shut?	That's what I want.
You got it.	How about twenty thousand?
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.	Don't you want to go to the airport?
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?	I kinda doubt it.
Where we go in1?	Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
You can trust him...	How long have you been married?
Can he trust you?	That's what matters, isn't it?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?	A Ford... We have a Ford.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?	Just... tell us what you want.
I've got to stop.	I'll tell you when.
You knew what I'd do.	Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
What did you do?  Albert?	Nothing. What could I do?
Nothing. What could I do?	Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?	Yes. I told him.
Yes. I told him.	What did he say?

How were things between you and Frank?	He was all right to me.
He was all right to me.	Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nothing more? Just another feller?	Nicer than most.

Did my brother Frank find out?	Your brother? What you talking about?
That's why you waited for me.	Not entirely. No.
Not entirely. No.	You sure about that?
You sure about that?	Sure I'm sure.
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?	Especially when I play the lead.
What kind of entertaining?	Now you're asking.
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?	He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Is he coming here?	Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
And what was that?	We're there now.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?	No. I didn't know that.

Oh, what you doing now?	Working at Woolworths.
Working at Woolworths.	That must be interesting.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?	They said he was drunk.
Did they give you a rough time?	No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
What happened to you, then?	How'd you find me?
See you later.	Where you off to?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?	Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.	That's what he was saying about you.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.	Where would I find him?
Where would I find him?	Today? At the races. He always goes.
I mean, what for?	That's what I was wondering.
Why would it?	It just would. He was always the same.
It just would. He was always the same.	Since when did he drink whisky?
Did you work with him, Keith?	At the Half Moon.
You coming back?	How could I stay away?
Do us a favour?	What, and get myself beaten up again?
What, and get myself beaten up again?	No chance of that.
They're friends of mine.	And that'll make me feel better?

Did you sleep well?	Yes, thank you.
How'd you know I wouldn't?	'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.	What's that supposed to mean?
What's that supposed to mean?	Think about it.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.	That little shit!
That little shit!	What about Keith?
What about Keith?	What about Keith?

Nothing is more important.	Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?	It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
I just left our friend in Miami.	How is his health?
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?	He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.	Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.	They feel cheated.
On the phone?	No, she's here.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.	Keep them alive.
He don't want to talk?	We worked it all out beforehand.
We worked it all out beforehand.	Are we going to eat or what?
Are we going to eat or what?	Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.	Don't I look like I'm listening?
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?	My lawyer went over this beforehand.
The same assurance we got from you.	What if I say shove it?
You want a war?	We got no choice.
We got friends in the commission.	I'm talking about Italians!
I'm talking about Italians!	What about Michael Corleone?
What about Michael Corleone?	He supports me.
He supports me.	Maybe, yes... maybe no.
Rosato, where's your brother?	Sitting right behind you.
I accept your generosity...	I won't keep you another minute...
What was that?	In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
How much more a month?	Eh...  Five dollars more.
It still hurt.  A lot.	I didn't mean to...
You liked it too.	Sure.  I loved it.
Sure.  I loved it.	If you enjoy it, you should do it.
I wasn't going to try anything.	Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
What's to be jealous of?	I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
This looks corny.	Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
What makes you say that?	Just thinking out loud.
Just thinking out loud.	Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.	But I didn't do this!
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.	Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
What have you done with him?	I put him to bed.  He's not there?
Thanks.  Why do you do it?	What do I do?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.	There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.	You did not know?
You did not know?	Well...no, not really --
Well...no, not really --	You and he are not doing things?
I'm not going to hurt anyone.	Yes.  I trust you.
You ever been married, Hanna?	Of course.  I am married still.
Of course.  I am married still.	Yeah?  What's your husband do?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?	He is dead now, twenty years.
He is dead now, twenty years.	Then you're as single as I am.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?	Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.	Expect nothing fancy.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --	The Master is waiting for you.
You'll feel better tomorrow.	Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
Did I hurt you?	Nothing I didn't deserve.
Nothing I didn't deserve.	Need some help?
Need some help?	Pray you, undo this button.
All right.  Let's take it off now.	What was that?
What was that?	It's too tight.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?	There are straps in back.
No.  It won't do.	What won't do?
What won't do?	You are much too human.
You are much too human.	What did you expect?  Bronze?
So it is going to happen after all.	What'd you say?
"That's from your movie, right? ""The only monsters are here."""	I don't remember that one.
I don't remember that one.	James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
Do you mind?	Not at all.
I never made it to Korea.	But you said --
I thought you'd given up on my picture.	I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
That only leaves the rest.	You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Do I have any other choice?	Very sporting of you, Clayton.
Run for what?	Can't you see?  It's raining!
Are you enjoying yourself?	Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.	Neither of us really belongs here.
Neither of us really belongs here.	Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.	Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
Is that really her?	David produced her last picture.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.	No.  The girl.
No.  The girl.	Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
What did I tell you?  Listen.	I don't hear anything.
I suppose you'd like the top down.	If that's okay?
If that's okay?	Nothing would please me more.
Good afternoon, Clayton.	Do I look okay?
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.	No harm done.
There's no people like you in my crowd.	No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
You're talking through your hat now.	Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.	You were a soldier?
You were a soldier?	I was an officer.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.	Everybody has stories to tell.
Ah.  A philosopher.	Thoreau with a lawnmower.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.	I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Sorry.  Not today.	But we have to match the other sketch.
Does that surprise you?	No, I -- you're a homosexual.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.	Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.	I'm not, you know.
I'm not, you know.	I never thought you were.
I never thought you were.	You don't think of me that way, do you?
You don't think of me that way, do you?	What way might that be?
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?	No.  At least not in the legal sense.
Did you kill anyone?	I don't like to talk about that.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.	All righty.  I understand.
Did you now?	I liked it.  We all did.
I liked it.  We all did.	Did anyone laugh?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.	Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
Is this David's doing?	This David's a friend?
All right, I guess.	I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.	No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.	That's exactly what I intend to do.
I'm not wearing an undershirt.	Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.	But it's just my face you want to draw.
You don't say?  Which picture?	"""Bride of Frankenstein."""
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.	And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?	You mean, like posed for pictures?
You mean, like posed for pictures?	Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.	What's to sketch?
Broke is more like it.	But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?	Football in college.
Football in college.	You went to university?
What did she mean by going flooey?	I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.	What was wrong?
What was wrong?	Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
These are your paintings?	What?  Oh yes.
What?  Oh yes.	Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Or would you prefer a beer?	No.  Iced tea's fine.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?	Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
And your name is --?	Boone.  Clayton Boone.
You coming, Boone?	I think I'll hang around.
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.	You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.	Good.  Fine.
I didn't ask George to invite you.	Then who did?
Yes.  Perfectly.	All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.	You didn't, Jimmy.
You only embarrass yourself.	Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?	You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Should you be drinking in your condition?	Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.	Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.	We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.	But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?	I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.	Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.	I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.	No.  But someone you can talk to.
Does the yardman come today?	Of course.  This afternoon.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?	I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
She is horrible.	She is beautiful.
He is not going to kill the old man?	No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.	Just go.  We can manage without you.
"Okay.  ""Frankenstein.""  Tell me everything."	Righto.  Let me see.
Then the rumors are true?	What rumors might those be?
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?	Everything.  Start at the beginning.
One likes to live simply.	I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?	Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
How are you?	Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?	Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?	"My version of ""take this job and shove it..."""

In Detroit. This weekend.	Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.	They were very upset.

That's not true!	Then why do you want to leave?
Would you like to see that?	I don't care.
I don't care.	I don't care.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.	I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.	Oh. You didn't tell me.
Oh. You didn't tell me.	I didn't know I had to.
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?	Whatever you want.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?	What about him?
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.	I brought it to you in the hospital.
I brought it to you in the hospital.	No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.	Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Uh, yes... Sure, David.	All right. Speak to you then.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.	Did you speak to Farlow?
Did you speak to Farlow?	Yes. We're suing.
I have so much to tell you.	You want to take a walk with me?
"No. I am a ""tubab."""	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Tubab means white man.
Take your time.	What do you mean?
How are you feeling about work?	Let's not talk about that now.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.	You're allergic to hay.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.	Everything all right.
I miss you, Annie.	I know. We miss you too.
What if she doesn't want to go?	She will if you think she should.
She will if you think she should.	And you think it's best if I don't come.
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...	I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.	Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
I don't understand. You just said he said no.	He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.	That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
You've already made arrangements!?	No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Aw... that's so sweet.	I love you.
I love you.	Do you? Do you really?
Sing it to me, Frankie!	How's my pregnant chick!
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?	Oh. Right. I'll call him.
We're very lucky.	The funeral's on Friday.
I should go get some of her things.	No, let me go.
No, let me go.	No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
What did he say?	Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?	I should be in by two.
I should be in by two.	Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Okay. You want me to pick you up?	Sure... What's Grace up to?
Sure... What's Grace up to?	Riding with Judith.
It's so cruel.	No. He had the choice.
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?	Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?	We have a business manager. The best around.
Good luck to you, Annie.	You too, Diane.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.	Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.	No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Sounds like something Tom would say.	Yes, it does.
I'd love to go there one time...	You and Frank ever take a vacation?
I was there for that shot, actually.	What was it like?
I understand, but Annie, please...	- See, what you can do for him --...
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...	Well, of course, right...
When you figure on branding?	Weekend after next...
Sure. As long as she don't mind.	There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
I don't believe it.	You know her?
I wouldn't let happen.	You know, you're a good kid.
Would you let me ride your horse?	Have you talked to Tom about it?
Have you talked to Tom about it?	Of course I have.
Of course I have.	I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
Grace, I need you to come with me.	No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.	He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
I can't... not yet...	There's no hurry. Take you time.
Can you drive?	Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.	It's never too soon to start.
That's not a question, is it?	You're catching on.
Isn't it like, obvious?	Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
She gonna be long?	Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.	What does she do?
What does she do?	She's an editor.
She's an editor.	Mmm. An editor.
Jude, you okay?	I'm okay... I'm okay.
Do you want to go around by the old road?	Why don't we just cut through the woods?
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!	I just could never say it!
It's warmer than I thought.	You want to go to a movie tonight?
You want to go to a movie tonight?	I thought your mom's coming up?
Did you notice -- no cane?	I know. Amazing.
I know. Amazing.	Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
You want to watch some television?	Maybe... look -- just...
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?	No, I'm just not that hungry.
Have you heard from Judith's parents?	No, not yet.
No, not yet.	How's Pilgrim doing?
Don't be such a baby!	You just showing off for her!
You just showing off for her!	You shut up, stupid!
IT WAS MY TURN!	YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
I can't believe it's the same horse.	We still have a way to go.
We still have a way to go.	How much longer do you think?
What are you looking at, young man?	How long were you married?
You ever miss it?	Does a horse miss a saddle?
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.	Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.	Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
Well, that'll happen.	Where did you learn all this stuff?
Where did you learn all this stuff?	What stuff is that?

Do you love me Rachel?	Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.	Like a sister?
Like a sister?	Jamie, sometimes it's...
Jamie, sometimes it's...	Like a real sister?
We'll hear sirens soon.	Then we'll be safe?
What are you doing out here alone?	Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.

I don't want to look pushy.	You won't look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.	Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Hell of a night.	Its not over yet.
Its not over yet.	Where are you going?
Leave Myers for the state boys.	The state police won't know how to stop him.
Get the outside shutters.	What are we doing?
What are we doing?	Making sure that no one can get in here.
Making sure that no one can get in here.	Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Isn't this all a little paranoid?	If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
You got your riot gun?	Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.	Go get it.
132 to 133 this is 134.	This is 132, over.
This is 132, over.	Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
Right here, Ben.	You look sharp. You understand?
You look sharp. You understand?	No problem, Sheriff.
These kids aren't likely to forget.	They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Where's that Deputy?	Be here in a minute.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.	Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.	It isn't a man.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.	They didn't know what they were fighting.
This is starting to spook me.	Least I'm not alone.
He's been here.	How do you know?
I am. Ben Meeker.	Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.	That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.

Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!	What's going on?
You're going to be late!	He shouts, too.
Hi, Annie, Laurie...	Hi, Dad. What happened?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.	You blame everything on kids.
Saving the treats for Bob?	Fun-ny. See you.
Well, are we still on for tonight?	I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
It's been totally charted.	We just talked.
Why didn't you wait for me?	We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.	That's not true. Here I am.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.	You guys will make a fabulous couple.
You still spooked?	I wasn't spooked.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.	Probably Mister Riddle.
Probably Mister Riddle.	He was watching me.
He was watching me.	Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.	He can still watch.
He can still watch.	That's probably all he can do.
Why did you hang up on me?	Annie, was that you?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.	I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?	I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.	Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.	I've already lost it.
He was standing right here.	Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
I have a place for that.	I forgot my chemistry book.
I don't want to.	Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...	I want to stay here and watch this.
You locked yourself in.	I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!	Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.	No, he's not.
Go get me a beer.	I thought you were gonna get one for me.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...	Just answer the damn phone.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.	And I can't keep you interested?
I gotta go.	Will you call me tomorrow?
We're all alone, aren't we?	Michael's around someplace...
My parents won't be back till ten.	Are you sure?
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...	I found the car! He's here!
You have the wrong feeling.	You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.	Exactly what do you need?
A man wouldn't do that...	He isn't a man.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.	May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.	I don't think so...
Laurie, you come with us...	No! Do as I say.
I killed him...	But you can't kill the bogyman.
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...	What is it, Laurie?
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!	It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Who is it?	Tommy, let me in!
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.	I saw him...
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.	There was no one outside.
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?	After the movie.
After the movie.	What about the rest of my comic books?
What about the rest of my comic books?	After the Jack-O-Lantern.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.	What about the bogyman?
What about the bogyman?	There is no such thing.
There is no such thing.	Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.	Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...	Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
Not any more.	Why are they under there?
Why are they under there?	Mom doesn't like me to have them.
I don't like that story.	But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Yes, I am.	Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Are you coming over tonight?	Same time, same place.
Same time, same place.	Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?	Yes, she is.
Yes, she is.	Will you get her for me?
Will you get her for me?	She's washing her clothes.
She's washing her clothes.	Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.	There's nothing else I can do.
I'm not responsible, Sam.	Of course not.
Of course not.	I've given them his profile.
Pull up to the entrance!	Shouldn't we pick him up?
Ever done anything like this before?	Only minimum security.
What does that mean?	It means... I see.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.	Are there any special instructions?
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'	If you say so.
If you say so.	Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
He'll barely be able to sit up.	That's the idea. Here we are.
I love that.  That's my type.	I can't believe it!
Come in, come in.	...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
That's just --	Look at this.
What are your favorite buildings, David?	You want to see some?
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?	Are you really interested?
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.	Well, let's hope so.
No, he called late last night.	I, uh, I'm very surprised.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.	He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.	And you, you-you're going?
Well, sometimes, some, uh...	I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
It depends on what way you want to go.	Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Well, I live downtown.	Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?	It's really terrible.
Oh, is that what it is?	Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Wow, it's the red one?	Oh, it's magnificent!
No, really, I really like him a lot.	No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
I know.  It's terrible!	I mean, I've looked everywhere.
We could...we could do that.	Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
It's really sad.	And it ruins everything else.
Oh, what, what do you do?	I'm an architect.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.	Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Is this your first job?	Really?  Is the food that bad?
Really?  Is the food that bad?	Oh no.  Not at all.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.	When did you first notice this?
Now I ca-can't remember.	Let's take a look.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?	This time I really think I have something.
How ya doin', man?	I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
...with the affiliates.	Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!	Yes, but you name names.
You--  Standards and Practices?	Ed Smythe, yes.
And you're in love overnight?	I care a great deal about him, yes.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.	Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.	If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Is something wrong?	Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?	Oh, all the time.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.	I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.	Oh, my God.
This is not an easy situation.	I know it isn't.
I thought you weren't coming.	I almost didn't.
I didn't sleep all night.	No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.	What do you expect me to say?
What do you expect me to say?	Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Not because of me, I hope.	Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.	But not over me?
Oh, don't say those words!	I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.	Why, you know the situation.
Elliot!  Don't!	Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?	Yes, he's just adorable.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.	Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.	Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
He's got like six gold records.	Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.	Oh, that's nice.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.	Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
Yeah, you would.	Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
What are you doing here?	Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.	Oh, what, in this section of town?
Oh, what, in this section of town?	Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--	You're out looking here?
How about you?	Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh.  Well, I live--	Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?	Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.	Where are you headed?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.	You're not lost.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?	I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.	Are you in love with someone else?
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?	But, you got four children!
But, you got four children!	I want one with you.
I want one with you.	Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Are you in a bad mood?	I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
It's so late.	Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
She has all the cooking talent.	No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.	Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
Aren't they great?	Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.	I know!  I know!
Hi.  How's she doing?	I am glad to see you.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.	Get his wine away.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?	Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.	Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!	How do you know?
How do you know?	Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
Why should I be afraid?	Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.	But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
Who is it?	What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!	But who?  Where did you meet him?

Move? Where to?	I'm going to put you on the third floor.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.	The third floor are low class rooms.
Pack the bags, we have to move.	Also, this is your bill for the last week.
Oh, my babies.	Anais, it is so good to see you.
We have to have a plan.	What sort of plan?
We are almost out of water.	We are almost out of everything.
I love you. Keep the children safe.	Paul! Then another voice.
Let me go. Children get off.	I will follow on the next plane. Go.
I have to stay.	No! Sit down now.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.	Get on the truck, Tatiana.
I will not leave without the twins.	We have to get out of here Tatiana.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.	Please, please try one more time.
It was substantial.	Tell me what it was.
What sort of car?	What does it matter.
What does it matter.	I want to know.
I have to go out to get food.	Go out! Where?
Go out! Where?	To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
What's the matter?	We're running out of beer and other supplies.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.	So where is the lamb?
So where is the lamb?	Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
Go to the roof now.	What for Paul.
What for Paul.	Do as I say. I will be there soon.
You could leave, Paul.	What are you saying, Tatsi?
They are being evacuated.	What about us?
What about us?	We have been abandoned.
Has Roger spoken yet?	No, Odette says he's in shock.
No, Odette says he's in shock.	How can we help him.
This won't do.	It will do just fine.
What is it, Paul.	Stay with the children.
Oh, my God!	Where are you hurt, son?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.	Dawn. Then they go.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?	I sent them home. Go and call them.
I sent them home. Go and call them.	I tried already. The phones do not work.
The president has been murdered.	Murdered! By whom?
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?	I couldn't help.
I couldn't help.	You could have asked for a favor.
Thomas wants advice?	He wants your wisdom.
He wants your wisdom.	Let's have dinner first.
Your brother's here?	Yes, with Fedens and the children.
What is this about no water?	It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
Where has all our beer gone?	Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.	How much beer?
What are you doing?	The lieutenant wants the register.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?	He has taken the presidential suite.
He has taken the presidential suite.	What! Paul storms off.
Paul, are you there?	Yes, thank you Mr. President.
All. What do you mean all?	The staff, the guests.
The staff, the guests.	The staff and guests! How many?
Why the hurry, Roger?	Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?	No, I don't want you going on the street.
No, I don't want you going on the street.	Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.	Who is this Simon?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.	Can I help you?
Can I help you?	I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.	What is his room number?
What is his room number?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Go downstairs, I will help you.
And how the hell are we going to do that?	Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
So what stopped her?	It's complicated. But don't worry --
-- bullshit --	-- the whole thing is falling apart!
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.	Not at all!
Looks like we're it.	More to the point. Where's our host?
Where is it??	I don't know!!
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.	You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
-- I did: down here.	And I think that's case --
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.	Yeah, me too.
This thing's going nowhere.	If this is someone's idea of a joke --
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.	As a tumor.
Pritchett, is that you?	Up here --
If you know where it is, get there!	Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!	It's not going to let us out!
What's down there?	The...Fourth of July.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?	You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
-- the stained glass --	-- yeah, we did that --
I'll meet you down there.	Take the gun.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.	I don't do groups.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!	For chrissake give me a hand!
This is the best we're gonna do.	It'll have to do.
Cheery looking bunch.	Better living through electricity.
-- you lose either way, Price --	-- listen to the man --
I was upstairs with Eddie --	-- that's the fact, bud --
-- that's the fact, bud --	-- where the hell were you?
We can do it...	Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
You hear somebody?	No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --	I don't think so...
There's always exceptions.	Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
Most fun I've had all day.	You need to get out more.
I'm better than that.	Don't push it.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?	I hope not.
...Jesus H. Christ.	So where's the party?
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --	-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- I pose you the same question --	-- and who's next on your list?
Where is she?	Stalking the wild poltergeist.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.	Really? Well, let it rip.
-- the sadistic prick --	-- in the act.
-- just not always in the sexual sense.	You're hurting me.
Could we have a word?	Oh, I think we're going to have several.
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?	Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
You think this is fucking funny??	No, no, it's just --
No, no, it's just --	-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.	Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?	Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.	You didn't think to ask?
You didn't think to ask?	I was in the middle of --
I was in the middle of --	-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
Please! Something! Oh-God!	Maybe if I --
And then what happens?	I think it's something better experienced then described.
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?	My wife. Where were we?
-- my loss --	-- even if I give you a million as well?
-- even if I give you a million as well?	Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
I'm ready now.	Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
Then tell me, please -- help me...!	Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.	Please! I need your help.
Please! I need your help.	Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --	-- no more --
I'll take my chances.	Well, I can't, sweetheart.
I was upstairs!	I never saw you --
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.	I think I'll do what I damn well please.
What is it??	Something with the power, I don't know!!
Good way to get your head blown off.	I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
Problem where? Looked good to me.	"""Dummy 6"" keeps losing his arm."
Houston, I think we may have a problem.	Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
Pritchett: what is going on?	He must've unsealed the room!
He must've unsealed the room!	How, he's supposed to be dead!
Don't know that it does.	Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Wish I could take the credit, but --	-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.	He must've beaten us all here!
For the love of God....please...?	Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
-- I'm coming --	-- something horrible...I don't understand --
It might have been her mother.	We don't have proof of that.
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...	You say you saw some activity here?
Are you all right?	A few years older, perhaps.
A few years older, perhaps.	How's your arm?
It looks delicious...	Why don't you pass me your plate?
Town records are coming up now.	What will they tell you?
By killing them?	By freeing them.
By freeing them.	I don't understand.
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -	I'm ok mommy.
Your father doesn't love us anymore!	What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
H-how long will it take?	Go to your room!  Now!
Where are we going to go, mommy?	We're going to go someplace new.
We're going to go someplace new.	What about all my other stuff?
What about all my other stuff?	We'll get it later.
Are we leaving mommy?	Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Can you talk to her?	She talks to me.
It's going to hurt us!	No it won't - no it won't!
Don't play games with me, little girl.	I didn't do anything, mommy.
I didn't do anything, mommy.	Well then who did?!
Well then who did?!	Maybe it was Colleen...
Can I do it again tonight?	We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.	Well I bet you they're happy.
Help me!  Please!!!	My God, I heard something!
She's down.  Help her...	Take me to her.
She says she's lonely...	Where is she?
Good night Angel...	Good night daddy.
Are we going back to California daddy?	Well, that all depends.
Mommy please help me!	Don't be afraid!
Look daddy!  It's empty!	That's great, honey.
What's he doing daddy?	He's blessing the house.
Can I have this room daddy?	Sure.  Did you see the others?
Sure.  Did you see the others?	I want this one, daddy.
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!	No...  NO!
Maura, what is this!	We're not going.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?	What are you talking about?
How are we doing?	I think everything's ready.
I think everything's ready.	Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
What are you talking about?	She has a...friend.  Colleen.
It just disappeared.  Literally.	I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...	Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Oh come on!	What about keeping an open mind?
But do you agree with me?	Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.	Well what do you think it is?
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...	So what are you saying?
So what are you saying?	I don't know what I'm saying.
What is it?	It was in the cellar.  Weird.
The heater's here.	Were you fooling with the power?
What the hell is that?	I don't know.  That's strange.
I wish I knew more about her.	Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
To our family.	To our family.
It's just going to take a while.	Whatever you say.
What's the matter?	Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.	Oh come on...
Oh come on...	I just, I don't know...
I just, I don't know...	What will Aubrey think?
What will Aubrey think?	Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?	White meat will be fine...
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.	You'll have to settle for turkey.
We don't know.	I could see if I detect the presence of something.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!	Come back to us honey!
Concentrate!  She can hear you!	Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.	Did you know her very well?
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.	Oh, that's nice...
Oh, that's nice...	May I come in?
You must be a Londrigan.	Yes, I am.
I didn't do anything...God saved her...	What's going to happen?
How long will it take!	It will not take long...
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.	What are you getting at!
There's something through that wall!	Well what is it!
Do you mind if I borrow it?	Not at all, if it can help.
Where did you find this?	It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.	I know what I saw.
Wha .... ?	The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
What am I looking for?	God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Buying some drugs, alright?	Oh, Terri ...
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?	Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?	What on earth were you doing down here?
Would you know this store again?	Sure.  Why?
Sure.  Why?	It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
How have you ... ?	Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
I'll boil some water.	I'll do it!
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.	It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?	I'm trying to quit.
What is it?	Why are you so interested?
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!	Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
It was off the statue.  In the club.	What happened to him?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?	Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.	Can we see?
Can we see?	You gonna buy?
You gonna buy?	I don't know.  Maybe.
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.	No.  We want ...
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.	Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
Wow.  Thank you.	No.  Thank you.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.	A prize?  For what?
How do we start?	It has already begun.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.	But how in God's name ...
Oh, I don't ...	C'mon.  It'll be great.
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?	What do you want?
Eighth room down, babe...	Guards come exactly every three minutes....
That was beautiful.	I laughed, I cried.
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.	Let's just forget it, I mean...
"""We all had our quarrels and parted..."""	"""But we'll be the same as we started..."
That was close....	Anna, I think you better stay....
Anna, I think you better stay....	You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
"""Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"""	"""How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"""
Now that's a lock.	Don't worry, we'll get it...
"""Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money."	"""Maybe we're ragged and funny."""
Count of three?	Why not just go now?
We're going in from the ground floor.	Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
"""And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."""	"""Every day you meet quite a few."""
"""A mule is an animal with long funny ears."""	"""He kicks up at anything he hears."
You got about five minutes and change.	"5:32.  ""Swinging on a Star."""
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.	Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...	There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....	Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
Welcome back to Vinci.	Last rites, sister?
My life is not some deal.  I...	It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Don't you just hate kids...	George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
What the hell....	You're supposed to be dead!
A little petting is not the issue!	Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...	Oh.  Well, what's this?
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.	Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
Catholic girls are scary...	Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.	Oh.  No.
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.	Oh, I'm so sorry...
What have you been doing?	Uh....old badminton injury.
I was the Warden?	How long were you in?
How long were you in?	Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.	Oh, you read that.
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.	Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
Cat got his tongue?	Actually he never told us what it was.
No, let me!	I don't care.
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.	Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...	But you're going to tell us anyway...
You certainly do.	So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
Remember that shoe you lost...	Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
Get away from there, convict!	Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.	For God's sake, chain this convict.
Don't be stupid...they...	Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Bastard!  If you were a true American.	Just shut up and hit me!
Why does this have to be so hard...	Tell me about it...
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.	Employer?  The president?
I'm supposed to fall for that?	Shucks.  Guess not.
We'll call it the Flying Donut!	The Dancing Dingus!
The Dancing Dingus!	The Jerky Circle!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --	I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.	He didn't look unhappy!
I'm happy enough.	Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.	I'm plenty happy!
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!	On Norville Barnes!
Now, Amy --	Consider this my resignation --

Oh, Norville --	Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!	Sure, Norville, sure...
You know, on farm route 17.	Oh yes! In Muncie!
Oh yes! In Muncie!	No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Sid found me the icepack.	Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
...You know! For kids!	...Why don't I just type this up...
You're from Muncie?!	Why yes, do you know it?
What a horrible little person.	Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Not at all. You're light as a feather.	The couch, please.
You can't print that!	He grins wolfishly.
Watch it, Archer --	It's about a dimwitted editor who --
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.	Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
Ya know, entry level!	Tell me about it.
Tell me about it.	I got big ideas, though!
I got big ideas, though!	I'm sure you do.
I'm sure you do.	For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --	I thought you served misfits here!
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.	It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.	This I know, Benny.
This I know, Benny.	This you're familia' with.
What the heck's she doin', Lou?	What the heck they doin'?
But, Buzz --	Say, that was a swell idea!
Say, that was a swell idea!	But, Buzz, you know I never --
But, Buzz, you know I never --	And Sid says you stole it!
And Sid says you stole it!	But Buzz --
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...	Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Awwww, buddy --	And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Wuddya mean, buddy?	Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!

Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --	An example must be made!
...Why, this is worthless.	Huh?! But, buddy --
My pleasure, sir.	Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?	Well, I --
...What's your pleasure, buddy?	Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.	Geez, I --
Well, frankly, I...	You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
My God! The Bumstead contracts!	Oh my God, sir!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!	Sir, my leg is on fire!
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!	Oh my God, sir!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!	Oh my God, sir!
Not even behind your back?	Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
But, sir! --	Get your feet off that desk.
...education, were you?	Well, I'm a college graduate --
Well, I'm a college graduate --	All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?	Well, I made the dean's list.
She's good, Bennie.	She's damn good, Lou.
Maybe he's wise.	He don't look wise.
She's got other problems, of course...	...Her mother needs an operation...
...He's not noticing, Benny.	Maybe he's wise.
Maybe he's wise.	He don't look wise.
He don't look wise.	Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
...and awduhs a light lunch.	She looks in her purse...
She finds him.	She sits down.
...Enter the dame.	There's one in every story.
There's one in every story.	Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.	Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.	She's looking for her mark.
I got gas, Bennie.	Yeah, tell me about it.
Yeah, tell me about it.	No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.	Ya get the special?
Ya get the special?	Fah from it...
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.	"What do you mean -- ""doctors that are people""?"
"What do you mean -- ""doctors that are people""?"	There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
At the Houmfort.	That's nonsense, Alma.
Good morning, miss.	Thank you for waking me.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?	If you say, miss.  If you say.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.	But, Mrs. Rand --
You don't believe in it?	A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
I think you need some help.	I'm afraid so.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.	I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
She can never be cured?	I've never heard of a cure.
I've never heard of a cure.	Is this disease common in the tropics?
But it's so far away...	That's rather nice, isn't it?
Where were you trained?	At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.	But she's not dead, Wes.
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?	Of course, Wes.
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.	Did you hear what he sang?
But don't you have to work?	By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Where do you think you're going?	It's my day off.
Thank you.  But who sits there?	My brother's wife.
She was beautiful.	I hated her.
I wanted to help you.	Help me? How?
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.	I imagined this so differently...
I heard you playing.	I often do.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.	Wesley can be very entertaining.
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---	Many people thought her beautiful.
I am not a frightened girl.	That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?	Of course not!
I heard someone crying -- a woman --	A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
Have the servants made you comfortable?	Yes, thank you.
It is not beautiful.	You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.	Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?	Got a meeting uptown.
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --	The phone's out.
The phone's out.	Yeah. Well, we can just --
Yeah. Well, we can just --	Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?	Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?	We'll talk in the morning.
Ready to go?	We're not going anywhere.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.	Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
This just isn't the best moment for this.	I know, I know. I had no idea --
I know, I know. I had no idea --	That this was going to be a key party?
In the car.	Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
You think I --	I have no idea.
I have no idea.	What's on your mind? Don't --
What do you mean?	Don't be dim.
Don't be dim.	Elena, what are you're talking about?
Elena, what are you're talking about?	I'm not surprised.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?	It's a starting place.
It's a starting place.	Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?	If you're going to insult me --
What's for dessert?	See for yourself.
See for yourself.	No advice from the experts, huh?
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.	So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Dinner in ten minutes.	You go dry off now.
The turkey in?	Stuffed and baking.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.	I do. I'm -- are you...?
I do. I'm -- are you...?	I... I think I am...
I... I think I am...	You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?	Hmm. Good night.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.	You want to go?
You want to go?	What do you think?
What do you think?	Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
You're staring at me.	I wasn't star--
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?	No thank you. We should be off.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.	Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?	I'm fine dad.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.	Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Damn right, but where the hell were you?	What are you talking about?
What the hell are you kids doing down here?	What do you think we're doing, dad?
Dad stop it!	Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.	That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?	That's besides the point.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --	Darn it, Dave.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.	And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Thank you Janey.	It was lovely!
Sure. Maybe coffee.	Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
I don't like coffee.	It'll warm you up.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?	I suppose. Why?
You're not a psycho!	The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
Here you are.	Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
I used to know how to cook.	It's not like we're too busy.
It's not a bother.	I insist.  Don't touch them.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.	Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
But not too ashamed.	Now you are being rude.
Now you are being rude.	And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Yes, it was -- I ended up --	No need to make excuses --
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.	Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.	One for you and one for me.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Am I right or am I right?
Am I right or am I right?	Shit. You're not planning --
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.	Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.	You going to tell dad?
You going to tell dad?	Would it matter?  And what's that?
Maybe you should have just a half.	Thanks for the advice dad.
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --	What is it?
Frankie opens them with his teeth.	Hey, it's a sellable skill.
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.	Great, thanks for the tip.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?	Who said so?
You get in trouble?	Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
I don't know.	Why did you -- with Sandy?
Why did you -- with Sandy?	I don't know.
I don't know.	You like him? He worships you.
Maybe we can just watch some TV.	There's a TV in the basement.
You have to follow me?	I dunno. I --
I don't ever want to see you.	Then why'd you come after me?
Did you tell Sandy?	Tell Sandy? What?
Want some gum?	Sure.  Twinkie?
Charles, what time is it?	Is this Charles?
Is this Charles?	What time is it?
What time is it?	Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?	I have plans.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?	Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Can I come?	It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Her name's Libbets.	Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.	Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
I love you.	That's nice. Are you drunk?
That's nice. Are you drunk?	I don't know. How do I know?
It feels warm.	One more shot?
Communist Viet Cong.	They left it in the jungle.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.	What are you doing?
What are you doing?	Just thought I'd stop by.
All my model planes.	The ones you built?
Mikey was looking for you.	Yeah? See ya.
Didn't want to miss anything.	Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Will, you can't blame yourself.	I had him!
I had him!	It's only gonna make you crazy.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.	About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
What's the D.A. got them on?	Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
Just after Leland Street.	What's that, then?
What about your shoulder?	Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Then change it.	How much closer would you say you were?
How much closer would you say you were?	I don't remember.
I don't remember.	Five feet?  Seven feet?
She your only sibling?	Twelve years younger.
This murder was in the papers, right?	Yeah.  All over.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.	Good.  He's up next.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.	We already did.
We already did.	Do it again.
Do it again.	But there wasn't any...
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.	But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.	Don't worry about him...
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.	We'll get the other one, though.
He would have liked that.	We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
What I saw?	Anything.  It's important.
I'll call him now.	First I need a copy of the key.
What are you doing here?	I told her to come.
We're sure it's hers?	Has her books in it.
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.	How do you mean?
How do you mean?	That boyfriend.  Randy.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...	You don't have to be involved, Will.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.	What are we thinking?
You know I remember that.	One word to I.A. and he walks.
One word to I.A. and he walks.	Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
You know my plan of action.	To do nothing.
What do you want to talk about?	You know what about.
I'm not expecting anyone.	That's not what he thinks.
That's not what he thinks.	What did he look like?
Your friend's all business.	I'm always all business.
Thought I smelled something.	Good to see you, too, Randy.
I don't know.	You don't know.
You don't know.	She didn't tell me.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.	Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
What kind of stuff?	Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.	The other guy?
The other guy?	I told you I don't remember.
I told you I don't remember.	After that she left the party to go to him.
After that she left the party to go to him.	How should I know?...
How should I know?...	Ran like hell to go to him...
She used some stupid code name.	What was it?
What was it?	Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
I don't know.	You don't know.
You don't know.	She wouldn't tell me!
She wouldn't tell me!	But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
You and Kay were like sisters?	That's what I said.
You want me to take you somewhere?	Long as it's fun.
Since grade school.	That's a long time.
That's a long time.	We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.	Must be tough for you.  What happened.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.	You're not missing much.
You're not missing much.	What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
You're not following procedure.	Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Yes.  Like that.	This an accident, Walter?
This an accident, Walter?	If you want it to be...
I told you that was an accident!	Then so was mine...
Then so was mine...	Don't you pull that shit with me.
Don't you pull that shit with me.	I didn't want to kill her, Will.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.	There's nothing more to talk about.
There's nothing more to talk about.	But we work so well together...
Randy Stetz is in jail.	Told you I could write an ending.
What about him?	He.  Well, he...
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.	I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
But you wanted to.	I was a mentor to her.
She was only seventeen.	But she was an attractive girl.
Down at the station?	Yes down at the station.
Thought you might find that.	You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Not without Claudia. Where is she?	I can't save her.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?	Follow me - that way - through my cell -
Are these not the answers you came for?	Yes... My God...
That's what the one who made me said.	How he must have loved you.
No, my beloved, my child.	If you say so. You are innocent.
I was waiting for you...	Listen to me.
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.	Knew? You mean he is...
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...	Then God does not exist...
Then God does not exist...	I have not spoken to him...
That is a picture, nothing more.	You mean we are not children of Satan?
So you have the answers...	Ah! You have questions?
Ah! You have questions?	What are we?
What are we?	Nothing if not vampires...
Nothing if not vampires...	Who made us what we are?
Who made us what we are?	Surely you know the one who made you...
Are you the leader of tis group?	If there were a leader, I would be the one.
We had feared we were the only ones...	But how did you come into existence?
Yes, and very beautiful.	Your lips, they didn't move.
Don't Louis --	Louis, put me in my coffin...
Louis, put me in my coffin...	I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
Not you my dear.	You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
You made us what we are, didn't you?	Stop her Louis!
Stop her Louis!	DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
And if I cut my hair again?	It will grow back again!
I have. Or there would be twice as many.	But you're the fairest by far.
Why always on this night?	What night? What do you mean?
I didn't realise.	Is this my birthday?
But if she dies...	It's only mortal death.
He can protect us, Claudia.	You really believe that?
So you felt it too!	Let him go, he said. Let him go.
Do you think I would let them harm you?	No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
This is monstrous!	Yes, and very beautiful.
This is no performance.	And no one knows but us...
She's no vampire.	No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.	You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Or her, or her - or any of them?	Claudia, you torture yourself.
How do I look?	Still my beautiful child.
It can't be -	It is! Take the back stairwell -
Louis, look at me.	I can't. Go away from me.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.	Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
You both did it?	I took your life. He gave you another one.
We're immortal. You've always known that.	Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
You want me to be a doll forever?	Claudia - don't -
Claudia! You did that?	Sit still. It's not finished -
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.	Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?	The way I learn everything. By watching you.
I want more.	What have you done?
I have to go now Lestat...	You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...	Yes. I remember...
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.	Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
That's all past, Lestat.	Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
No... You come back to me Louis...	Are you mad????
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!	Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!	That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
She's here, your wounded one.	What are you saying?
What are you saying?	You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
Lestat - finish this -	You finish her - if you feel so much -
The girl, Lestat -	I know. Let her alone.
What do you imagine you are Louis?	I don't pretend to know.
Paris? You came from Paris?	As did the one who made me.
But how do you know?	Read her thoughts.
I know. It gets cold so fast.	We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Dear God, what have I done?	You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
What have I done?	You have fed. You were made for this...
The crucifix -	Forget the crucifix. Take him.
Come, you're going to feed now.	I want a woman.
You really want to be with them?	Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -	You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
I can't go through with it, I tell you.	Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.	But why do you want me?
Let's call that a start.	I can't do it.
I can't do it.	You've just done it -
You've just done it -	Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
Give it to me!!!	Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Vampires. We thrive on blood.	I want it!
You're not afraid of anything, are you?	Why should I be?
They would have killed you -	Then my luck would have changed.
Then my luck would have changed.	You want death? Is it death you want?
No... it can't end like that...	But it has. There is no more to tell.
But why did you tell her?	How could I not? She had to know.
How could I not? She had to know.	And did you lose her? Did she go?
Shall we go on?	He did it to make you stay with him!
You loved Yvette...	Can a vampire feel love?
Can a vampire feel love?	You loved your wife, surely.
You said the slave had a crucifix...	Oh, that rumour about crosses?
Oh, that rumour about crosses?	You can't look at them...
The story about stakes through the heart?	The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.	What about coffins?
What about coffins?	Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.	We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?	Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
Well, what a lucky break for me.	Perhaps lucky for both of us.
It's just a room...	So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?	I'm a vampire.
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?	A child who can't die...
What about a radio?	Sorry. Emergencies only.
Sorry. Emergencies only.	What the hell would you call this?
You're in 201 and 202.	Is that bad?
Is that bad?	Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
What can I do for you?	Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.	Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Listen to me. He's here.	Who? Who is here?
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.	Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.	That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
Oh, god, it's you --	You're okay. Thank god.
I'm holding your hand!	No, you're not.
I don't know...	Come on, you can make it.
There's no way to lock it.	What do we do?
Be careful, Julie.	I've got to see.
Let him go. I believe him.	Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?	The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Karaoke -- perfect.	Don't even think about it.
Don't even think about it.	Okay, I won't.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...	I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.	Karla! You promised.
Karla! You promised.	I also promised Tyrell.
I'm the King of the World.	No, I'm the King of the World.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...	Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.	But, he said he'd try.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?	Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Okay, okay. You're right.	I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
There's nothing between Will and me.	Yet. Nothing yet.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.	Yeah, right -- whatever.
Yeah, right -- whatever.	I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
I thought you were out of town!	What are you doing in my closet?
I thought you were out of town!	What are you doing in my closet?
Checking the locks again?	You know me to well.
I love it here.	It's gonna be great.
Don't kill me --	Wait, it's Nancy --
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.	Fine. Show me the body.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.	Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.	He's in it with Willis?
He's in it with Willis?	I guess so.
Come on. We're gonna be okay.	Did you get help?
There was a body! I swear it!	Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.	I wasn't dreaming.
What? What are you talking about? Where?	It's in my room!
No, no, no. This was really sweet...	I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.	It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
What do you mean, Julie?	He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
You sure it's okay with you?	Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
It was one year ago...	It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
To get out of Southport?	Right. Now I remember.
You think that's a good place to hide?	I don't know, but I'm starving.
I'll come with you.	Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.	We gotta get out of here. Now.
Oooh, the mainland --	Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Is there a problem here?	Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Why? He can't help us.	He's probably the only one who can help us.
To a great weekend --	Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...	I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Rio de Janeiro!	Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?	Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
Well, I'm in school and --	How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
And so could you -- crazy fool.	You stumbled into my hiding place.
You stumbled into my hiding place.	Must have missed the sign.
What's going on?	Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
He leave you?	No. I shot him.
You guys lost?	Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Where'd Estes go?	What is up with that weirdo?
What is up with that weirdo?	I'll go find him.
We'll only be a second, okay?	Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
They were cut loose.	Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.	So why are you still here?
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.	Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
Where is Miss Wollsten?	She's in her room.
) You feel the symptoms?	My friend -- what can one say --
We will see who is the first to die.	Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.	I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!	Poor Cathy --
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!	On my word! That's what they believe.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?	I think not.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.	They shall not hurt you
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?	No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
What are you doing?	I was looking for you.
She has never mentioned her family.	How old is she?
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?	It was, the plague
I felt he did not like me.	That should decide it or you --
But one must love a father.	The General  you don't even know him.
I have forgotten it, dear.	My last name is Pherides.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.	What is it -- what are you talking about?
What is it -- what are you talking about?	You have forgotten my last name?
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?	What an odd question!
You are fortunate in your father.	Thea is an orphan.
That your father and I	"No. I mean your other secret -
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -	Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.	This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.	"I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.
Your daughter is ill.	She's not too well.
She's not too well.	What is her illness?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?	Why -- no not before Thea came
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -	Listen to what I say --
Listen to what I say --	When you make sense I'll listen.
Thea is so like her  in every feature	If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
But the war, the army  they need you.	Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.	We still don't know that it's the plague
It makes me fear her.	I can't understand that.
There is something evil about her.	Oh, now  now look here
Thea, what's wrong?	The General threatened me.
Why in the world can't you?	He hates all my race.
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --	You see? Thea believes it, too!
You're crying. Why?	I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --	Everything's so simple. I like you.
But they're somebody's children.	Are you running a business or a charity ward?

Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?	Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.	Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?	You're nobody. You have no identity.
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.	You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.

Where are you going?	Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?	She was here first.
Now look, did you buy anything?	Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.	We'll save them for seed. A toast!
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?	George . . .
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?	Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.	Some other time, George.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.	Well, what about all your other friends?
I'd like to do that.	In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.	All right, sir.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.	You like it? I'll send you a box.
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?	Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Oh, George, George, George.	Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!	Oh, George, George!
Oh, George, George!	You have no idea what's happened to me.
You have no idea what's happened to me.	You have no idea what happened . . .
Where're you going?	Going up to see Zuzu.
What is it, a sore throat or what?	Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.	The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Is it snowing?	Yeah, just started.
Yeah, just started.	Where's your coat and hat?
Where's your coat and hat?	Left them at the office.
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .	Please, let's not stop, George.
Please, let's not stop, George.	I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
After that, who cares?	That does it  come here.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.	Don't you like her?
Don't you like her?	Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
Would you rather leave?	No, I don't want to be rude.
No, I don't want to be rude.	Well, then, sit down.
Where'd you get that dress?	Do you like it?
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?	Didn't you tell her?
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.	Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.	I'm going to scream!
Come on, tell me.	If I told you it might not come true.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.	You may kiss my hand.
You may kiss my hand.	Ummmmm . . .
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.	Too young or too old?
I'm not very good at this.	Neither am I.
Neither am I.	Okay  what can we lose?
Well, I don't.	You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Made up your mind yet?	I'll take chocolate.
How about that one there?	Hmm? Well, I . . .
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?	Sure, sure I am.
Sure you do -- you win either way.	I'm supposed to.
I can't wait to get there.	But of course.
When do we get to the lighthouse?	Soon, dark eyes, soon.
Wheee!  Faster!	How fast is enough?
How fast is enough?	I want to go faster!
Great!  Find one for me.	With butter, if they got any....
Come on, you guys.	Well, I don't know....
How fast does this go?	With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
Get on the rocks!	Swim for it!
It's okay, it's okay....	Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.	What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?	I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
Someone pop your balloon?	No problem, no problem.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.	I was counting on hours.
Your dad must be really pissed.	We better go back in.
We better go back in.	It's not going to be easy.
Maybe by now they are.	They're moving pretty fast.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.	I hope that's the cousin.
Yeah, it's her job.	Is she responsible for the punch?
What is it?	We're hung up on something.
Why'd they decide to move?	Too hot in the lighthouse?
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.	Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?	Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
Listen to Andy, Sean.	We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
Where're we going?	Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
I don't know.	What the hell, we're steering for it.
Loser sails home alone.	You're betting what you already got.
Coming up!  Give way!	Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
We're carrying weight.	We'll take your supercargo.
We're hung up here.  Snagged.	Can you get us a line?
Sean!   Catch the rope!	The rope!  The rope!
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?	Anyone got another set of sails?
You coming up on him?	You bet.  Hang on....
I thought you said she was going with us?	Let's just go sailing, okay?
Let's just go sailing, okay?	Want to talk about it?
Want to talk about it?	Want to swim home?
No!  It's still there!	What is it?  What's there?
What is it?  What's there?	It's still there!
It's still there!	I need a hand here....
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?	Oh, yeah.  Sure.
I'm going out there.	Hey -- you can't do that.
You're too close.  Back off.	Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Untie that rope.	Please.  It's my job.
I can't let you take her out.	You can't stop me.
I know just where to go.	Not the drugstore!
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?	Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.	Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
If there is, develop it!	You got it.
We got a helluva tide this month.	Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
On your own time?	Happy to do it.
Happy to do it.	Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
Dad, I'm sorry....	Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?	Sean's still out there.
I passed out, but I'm okay.	At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Mike?  Is that you?	Pop.  I'm sorry.
Pop.  I'm sorry.	It's okay.  What happened?
I got something for you to do tomorrow.	I kind of had plans....
Is Hooper coming to dinner?	Not till next year.
Bartending?  I'm 17.	Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.	I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
Do I have to?	You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
What else you got?	Let's see -- you got a minute?
Let's see -- you got a minute?	Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.	Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Is that what it is?	You're damn right that's what it is.
Wait a minute....	Too late, it's written.
May I have this dance?	Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.	Can't you tell?
Okay, so that's it.	Is there one in these waters?
Is there one in these waters?	What makes you think there might be?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.	Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
We don't know that, do we?	But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.	Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?	The whale's mouth?
The whale's mouth?	The Shark's mouth.
Look at that:	First things first.
What is it?  What's the matter?	Mike's out there.
I'll give notice.	Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
What'd I say?	That you were fired.
It was bad, wasn't it.	The goddamn smell is always the same.
The goddamn smell is always the same.	Are you going to be able to sleep?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.	Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Where's my day book?	In the den.
You have to smoke so early in the morning?	It's good with coffee.
It's good with coffee.	So's a donut.
Need a ride?	As far as the office.
Let's get the kid home.	Home it is.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?	And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.	I did, I did.
Do I have to talk to those two?	My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting	Perfect.  Look at this ---
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.	Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Did he raise the Kids?	Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.	Yeah?  Then what?
Did you say Cable Junction?	That's what he said.
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?	Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?	10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
They made me go with them.	Sure they did....
Dad!  Dad!	I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
Can I go with you today?	You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Can I go swimming?	No.  Find your brother, okay?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.	Shouldn't he be at home?
We're going to die.	It's all right, we're okay.
It killed her.  It ate her.	Shh.  Shhh....
I told you, remember?	Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.	Now I really want to see it.
You're not going out right away, are you?	Waiting for Andy.
Waiting for Andy.	I want you to meet my cousin.
I want you to meet my cousin.	I will, I will.
How old is your cousin?	Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.	I'm not crazy about blind dates.
Terry!  You okay?	Help!  Help!
Help!  Help!	Okay, okay, coming....
The wind drift is lateral.	What's that mean?
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.	Anything.  Anything.
What're we going to do in the mean time?	I dunno.  We'll think of something.
Just like this.	What about sailing?
What about sailing?	The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.	It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
Right after, the Kids went out?	What Kids?  Who went out?
Mike?  Our Mike?	Yep.  Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
About damn time.	What the hell is it?
How much longer?	Until we find something.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.	Figure they split?
I don't care.	I love it.
I thought you were grounded.	I can go out if I want to.
I'm not sure I can.	It'll be fun, come on!
We'll be over by the lighthouse.	I'll be right there.  Wait up.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.	Is there something I don't know about?
He's got to help or it won't work.	Sean, baby, please....
They're turning around.	Coming about, then.
I don't think she's such hot stuff.	When are we going out?  You and me?
I want to go with you!	Quiet!  Shhh!
Do I have to play with the little kids?	Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.	You always go with Andy.
You always go with Andy.	How was dive class?
Be reasonable, please....	Forget it, he won't listen.
Oh, my God....	What the hell is he doing?
Wave to my son.	How the hell do we get him down. from there?
I think we got a couple of live ones.	Brody's riding his tower.
Don't feel bad.	Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
Go on, you're tired.	No, I'm fine, thanks.
We're ready for you.	I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
Absolutely.  Good idea.	With those camera lights and...
With those camera lights and...	He's going with you, Doctor.
I'll need more men to look.	Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.	We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
You see the three-quarter socket?	Yeah.  Down there.
Are you okay?	I'm  fine.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.	I want that shark, Kathryn.
I want that shark, Kathryn.	You don't have to prove anything.
You don't have to prove anything.	Only to myself.
Michael, you're not going down there.	I am.  You're not.
I am.  You're not.	But you --
Somebody better get down there!	It's all controlled from the Control Room.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.	You wanted to know about a cave?
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!	What do you mean, we don't?
Michael, take deep breaths.	I have to get out of here.
I can't take water, Kathryn.	Yes, you can.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.	... He ought to put him in here.
... He ought to put him in here.	It's too soon to move him.
It's too soon to move him.	So tell Calvin.
So tell Calvin.	I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.	Well, that's why you got it.
No, we'll go through here.	... Mean through the tubes?
... Mean through the tubes?	Yes.  It's faster.
Yes.  It's faster.	No,  I'm not going through there.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.	They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.	I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
You want me to stay?	Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.	Sean, that's right...
I can use a shot of what he's got.	... Me, too.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.	No, you're not.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.	Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
After what happened to us?	I know I can capture it.
I know I can capture it.	Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
You all right?	I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
And leave me down here???	Make up your mind.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?	... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
It's romantic down here.	Oh, yeah.  Very.
Oh, yeah.  Very.	You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.	Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.	That's a lot of ground to cover.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!	They just wanted to say hello.
They just wanted to say hello.	... Friggin' fish.
What do I do now?	Take a deep breath and hold it.
Take a deep breath and hold it.	That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.	Just put your mask on.
Where's the rubber band?	Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.	I don't have a choice.
And what else is bothering you?	... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.	Yeah, you really don't like him.
Yeah, you really don't like him.	I don't like what he does.
I don't like what he does.	It's his work.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?	Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Not enough loving.	Get out of here!
My imagination isn't that good.	Honey, I gotta go.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.	They're acting very strange suddenly.
Well, not much longer to go.	What is it, 97 days?
What is it, 97 days?	Till this opens, not our wedding.
Till this opens, not our wedding.	Hope I make it through both.
Hope I make it through both.	You will.  I'll see to it.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.	She, Mister Hutton.
She, Mister Hutton.	He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...	How'd it get in here?!
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.	Thanks to you.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.	Get ready to go.
Get ready to go.	Believe me, I am.
Believe me, I am.	Brian, he's coming around!
I think that you and I are natural enemies.	And here I thought I was charming you.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.	Some miss all their shots.
Some miss all their shots.	Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.	Thanks for helping.
Thanks for helping.	Not at all.
Not at all.	Why are you?
Why are you?	I like it when they wake up.
I like it when they wake up.	So do I.  But for different reasons.
So do I.  But for different reasons.	And I like you.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.	Should be coming out of it soon.
Should be coming out of it soon.	Just watch it when he does.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.	Afraid I can't do that.
Afraid I can't do that.	You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
We're taking that shark alive!	Let's hope he knows that.
You look like an orange worm.	Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.	What in hell is that?
I want that shark alive.	So do I, love.
You can get killed!	I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.	Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.	Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
I thought they were clever.	I can have them walk backwards.
I can have them walk backwards.	No, no.  That won't do.
No, no.  That won't do.	I told you, something's upset them.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.	Make this quick!
Nobody told me.	I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?	They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.	Fine.  Have them do some.
Fine.  Have them do some.	I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.	Yes, aren't we all.
Don't blame yourself.	I should have never listened to Calvin.
When did this happen?	Ten minutes ago.
He's a young one.	And big for his age.
I think they'll come out now.	They still seem nervous.
How you doing, Kelly?	I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.	Better than catching Sean's herpes.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?	Someone's looking for you.
Let's go, let's go!	It's okay, Sean.
It's okay, Sean.	Take it up.
Told you you'd like it.	Now what's this do?
Isn't this fun!	Can hardly wait to do it again.
I don't know, what else is there?	I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!	The one that goes underwater?
The one that goes underwater?	Yes, it's great!
Yes, it's great!	No, Kelly, I don't want to...
No, Kelly, I don't want to...	Come on, it's fun!
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.	No, think of something else.
No, think of something else.	Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
You were great out there!	Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Well, I needed a cold shower.	Come on!  Check this out!
You gonna work at The Kingdom?	Depends on big brother.
Depends on big brother.	I'm a water-skier.
I'm a water-skier.	Are you really?
So, you just get here?	Yeah, from Boston.
'Course they're also so rich.	... Massachussettans aren't.
... Massachussettans aren't.	How long you staying?
How long you staying?	I don't know, it depends.
I don't know, it depends.	You like Florida?
Don't you dare.	Can't help it... ahh...
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!	Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
I don't talk that way.	Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.	Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!	I am serious.
The space shuttle has landed!	Hold still, damn it!
Hold still, damn it!	What're you doing later?
What're you doing later?	Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.	I thought I was your boyfriend.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?	You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
How far away is filter number four?	Five hundred yards.
Five hundred yards.	You have a man near it?
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?	It's large enough...
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.	Thanks.  Bullshot.
No, South Georgia.	What the hell's there?
Polar bears in Georgia???	South Georgia, Antarctica.
The world's southern most reaches.	How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?	Reach for the limit I always say.
Reach for the limit I always say.	I'll remember that, my Lordship.
Make sure you put this back.	Aww, can't I keep it?
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?	Calvin said it was all right.
Calvin said it was all right.	Yeah, well I didn't!
What kind of trouble?	It's not closing, Mike.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.	Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
She still talking to you?	We're in love.
Who's grown up?	Gee, it's good to see you!
Gee, it's good to see you!	I want to see Kathryn.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?	Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Took it this morning.	He needs a haircut.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.	So was Dad.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!	Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!	Look great, don't I?
Look great, don't I?	Got a job for me?
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.	That bugger moves fast.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.	She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....	Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.	It's time for tea, Grandma.
Can I make sandwiches...?	Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Daddy, why can't I...?	Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....

But you always let me....	Not today.  Come on, Thea....
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....	Watch me, Grandma....
You'll spoil her.	That's what grandmas are for.
Where is she?	How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....	Where's my mother?
Where's my mother?	I don't know....
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....	But it went away...We would have known....
Where have you been...?	What's wrong?  What happened?
What's wrong?  What happened?	Thea was attacked by a shark....
Close the door.	They're at the beach....
No fair, I'm not armed.	Then don't come any closer.
Then don't come any closer.	Turn it off....
What the hell are we arguing about?	I don't know...You...I don't know.
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....	My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Make a list.	We need milk....
We need milk....	Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....	We need beer....
We need beer....	I'll be right there.
It sure is good to be home....	It sure is....
We'll be there....	You make sure they come?
Beginning of what?	Whatever happens next.....
At least he doesn't have a beard....	Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
You want to try your hand at something...?	I'd be afraid of losing....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....	I can't help it....
You caught me....	You're not interfering, Ellen....
It'll grow on you.	I like it.  Really....
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....	I'm not on vacation....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....	He knows what he has to do....
They won't kill it....	We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.	Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....	We're going down.  All of us....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?	What difference does it make?  It's here....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....	You have something to say about everything....
A big one....	A small one...Your brother won't be here....

I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.	I'll miss you....
I'll be in to read you a story.	Good night, Daddy....
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?	The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....	I'm still five....
No, no...It's too dangerous....	Mommy lets me....
Can I ride one sometime...?	It's too dangerous....
In a minute....	What's going on?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.	There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
It got him....	Why'd you come out here?
Why'd you come out here?	Why'd you take the boat?

Things change, Kundun.	Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
I have more men.	I have smarter men.
How could I ever leave?	It may not be your decision to make.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?	It is a difficult situation.
It is a difficult situation.	I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?	Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
It is possible, Holiness.	You are unharmed?
Like my mother.	I see that.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.	We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.	You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.	My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--	I need to see his habitat.
It seems like we're getting lower.	It happens when I land.
It happens when I land.	Why are we landing?
Why are we landing?	'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.	<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
Where is he?!	I don't know!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.	I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
I can arrest you!!	Then do it!!
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.	Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?	<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.

We'd only just met.	Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?	I'll need any and all topographic studies.
You take care.	You talk to Bickerman?
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?	Just those two.
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.	Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
Where is he?	Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Can you confirm visually or just radar?	Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
The more he thrashes, the better.	You ready on shore?
And again.  How would you get him on land?	That's actually the easy part.
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--	'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.	Bastard bit my chopper.
"He never said ""go""."	Get the gun.
He's gonna live?	Yeah.  Thanks to you.
You're gonna be okay.	Guess I finally got bit.
Guess I finally got bit.	Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.

What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.	As if.  Will you miss me?
Such the flirt.	U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and...	But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
You sure?  I don't mind...	No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
Get him onto shore.	He heeds a tourniquet.
He's through fighting.  Look at him.	I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?	He's floating.  Take it home.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.	<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Thing we can lift it?	Maybe.  Don't mush it.

Like little children.  You okay?	Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.	Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I didn't say it like that.	You <u>did</u>, you--
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.	Just forget it.

I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--	You flew up here because your boss--
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.	I'd be able to see something.

Why are you here?  Really.	I <u>told</u> you.

He's done.  He's dying.	Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
If you get a safe shot...	I'll take it!

Half mile up, there's a clearing.	You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?	I'll call the coroner.
Did you get him?	I don't know.  Back the truck--
You like Jack?	<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.

Hector thinks you like him.	Well Hector's a giant cracker.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.	You think Jack's handsome?
You think Jack's handsome?	What is this?
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?	I asked you to be nice to him.
You threw it at me!!	I just let go of it.
I thought I saw...	It looks like a branch.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.	We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?	I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
You're sort of a rude person.	It's just that--
You have a thing against museums?	I got nothing against--

Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?	Well.  At wakes.
Well.  At wakes.	This is a little different.
This is a little different.	I can look at dead things.
He just came up screaming.	Did he say anything?
Did he say anything?	He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.

Hot damn, Clarice.	He knew her...!
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.	But why? He didn't weight the others.
"""Desperately random."" What does he mean?"	Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Lecter said a lot of things.	He's here, Ardelia.
Boy, is that smart...	Why does she keep repeating the name?
What'd I do?	"Stay cool. Just remember to call him ""God."""
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?	Never cock. Just squeeze.

You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?	That wasn't me.
Okay, Miss Starling?	Okay, Mr. Yow...
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?	I think we may be, yes.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.	You do until six p.m.
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.	Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.	Miggs has been murdered.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.	Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Who's the subject?	The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.	Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?	I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?	I think so.
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.	Thank you, Clarice.
Thank you, Clarice.	Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.	Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?	Yes...! They were screaming.
Yes...! They were screaming.	So you ran away...
I heard a strange sound...	What was it?
He kills w-	No! That's incidental.
A cattle ranch?	Horses - and sheep...
Horses - and sheep...	How long did you live there?
Why so briefly?	I - ran away...

How many women has he used, our Bill?	Five... so far.
It's much better than your shoes.	Maybe they'll catch up.
Maybe they'll catch up.	I have no doubt of it.
I have no doubt of it.	Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
All that detail, just from memory...?	Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.	Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
I am, yes.	May I see your credentials?
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.	Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
Of course it counts. How do you play?	Officer Starling. Welcome back.
Time, Pilch! My move.	No fair! You lured him with produce.
Are you alright?	Can we rest soon?
My God, you've grown up.	We leave in the morning?!
Will you go back to England?	I have nothing to go back for.
No. I will find you.	Do not.  Promise me.
Because what I am interested in is right here...	What would you have me do?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?	Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.	How did you learn English?
"""We're a breed apart and we make no sense""...?"	In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...	Thank you so much.
The Ottawa are gone.	Why did they turn back?
There was no letter.	I sent three men to Webb!
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.	What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
Yes. Go ahead.	What the bloody hell plan is this?
One called Magua arrived.	He delivered no such message.
My God, Alice.	It can be dangerous...
Will you consider that?	Yes. Yes, I will.
And by sea!	You still have an aversion to the water?
You still have an aversion to the water?	"Aversion?  No... ""Hatred""... ""Loathing""..."
And if we're unlucky?	You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
That is sedition! Treason!	That is the truth!
That is the truth!	I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!	Do not let gratitude get in the way...
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.	Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Fort Edward, then?	No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.

We were headed...	...Fort William Henry.
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?	...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
What did you say?	I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.	You're not coming with us?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?	We'll see in the morning...
Many men here, their homes are in the path.	That's all, sir.
And what is that?	"The Crown ""negotiating"" the terms of service?"
Advance, Sergeant Major!	Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
What is enough?	Heart. Give Magua new heart.
Gold could be arranged.	For Munro children?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?	The King? The King has mountains of gold!
Excuse me. What did you say?	"Magua say: ""Yes. Good idea."""
Carry them to England to your King with pride.	Allow me to consult with my officers.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!	Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.

Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.	Can't we fix it?

Tell that one, Hollis--	Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--	Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
We don't need a new jail.	That's a matter of interpretation--
That's a matter of interpretation--	We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--

He agreed it wasn't exactly news--	Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.	Your mother's family is Spanish?
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.	You told me one time it was true love.
There must have been somebody.	I was too busy.
I was too busy.	Nobody's too busy.
I never said that. It was just that boy--	"""That boy""--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!"
Mami, how old were you when my father--	He was killed.
He was killed.	Right. When he was killed.
Right. When he was killed.	A little older than Paloma is now.

Okay? He's not here?	No. Is he sick?
No. Is he sick?	He's going to wish he was dead.

That was the night he disappeared?	Could of been. That was white people's business.
Could of been. That was white people's business.	And when my father was Sheriff?
And when my father was Sheriff?	What about it?
What about it?	What was your deal with him?
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.	And that was the last time you saw him?
Can I get this?	Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
You got in late last night.	Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
What's she singing about?	What do you think?
You gonna stay out here?	For a while.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.	Of course you can.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--	He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
That's how I ruined my stomach.	I'm surprised he bothered with it.
I thought he busted you a couple times.	Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?	Time marches on.
Time marches on.	How much you got left?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?	Couple months before I was born--
What was your father's name?	Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.

I thought you got through that pretty well.	They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.	People liked him.
People liked him.	Most people did, yeah.
Your mother still doesn't like me.	I can't name anybody she does like these days.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--	She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--	So she tells me three times a week.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.	Want to take a walk?
He's all yours.	Are you okay?
We haven't talked since high school.	Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
They've got my Amado.	Got him here?
Got him here?	Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.	I'll see what's going on.
You think we need a new jail?	Well, it's a complicated issue--
You'd do a good job.	How 'bout you?
How 'bout you?	Don't know if I'll still want it.
Don't know if I'll still want it.	I didn't want to be going around your back.
I didn't want to be going around your back.	I appreciate you telling me.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.	I been working on a few things.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.	They got telephones.
They got telephones.	Gotta be in person.
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--	The shooter local?
The shooter local?	Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.	You don't need to cuff me.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--	And people better clear out of here! Now!
You telling me what to do, Roderick?	No, Sheriff, I'm just--
That the problem, son?  You Slow?	Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--

Hell of a spot to put a business.	But you don't see much competition, do you?
How come you don't took familiar?	Been away. Up to Houston.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.	I know that.
I know that.	Why you think that was?
You going to tell her?	You going to tell him?
You going to tell him?	He doesn't need to know all my business.
He doesn't need to know all my business.	He's gonna find out.
He's gonna find out.	So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
Hokey enough for you?	I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
Take a look at this.	A Nix specialty?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.	You heard right.
You heard right.	You ever been married?
My life was too weird for her.	I love weird.
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.	Who is he?
How'd you spell that again?	D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Who did this?	All right.  It was...
Who did this?	I told you --
You did.  Didn't you?	Why would I do that?
What about death?	It's an illusion.
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?	I know him.  I saw him.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!	It's him... it's him.
I'll tell you.	You'll do more.than that.
So tell me where Nix is buried.	I don't know.
What is he?	Maybe he'll show you.
He's with us...	He's with us... He's with us...
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.	Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
Is it finished?	I think so.
... oh... God...	I'm here, Harry.
Are you all right?	Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
I was so afraid.	Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	I'm sure.  He's dead.
I'm sure.  He's dead.	I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.	I'm here, aren't I?
It was more than that, I think.	He was the real thing, right?
He was the real thing, right?	Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
He taught all this to Swann?	Some or it.
So why did you marry him?	That's my business. Harry.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?	It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.	Okay.  I'll keep digging.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.	Yes.  You do that.
They were jealous of him.	Why?  Because he had you?
Why?  Because he had you?	He... didn't have me..  I told you-
He... didn't have me..  I told you-	You didn't marry him for love.
I don't know where you'd start.	Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?	They won't tell you anything.
They won't tell you anything.	I can be very persuasive.
You don't believe me.	He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
He's a secretive man.	And you don't ask questions?
Does that mean...?	We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.	But obviously you still care what happens to him.
What about me?	Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.	No word from D'Amour?
Good.  There.  Yes?	You saw this?
... they believe you.	Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Where the fuck is he?	He got up and walked.
He got up and walked.	After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
Oh, I've got plenty.	I'd like to hear them.
They weren't worth a damn.	I heard he was the best.
I heard he was the best.	If he was so good why's he so dead?
Trickery and divinity.	Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
You believe that?	I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...	Heaven and Hell?
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.	I'm sorry, D'Amour...
I tried to pay you off.	Was that Swann's idea?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.	Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
I can't let you in.	Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.	You want more money, is that it?
I want to speak to Dorothea.	I'm afraid she's not in.
I'm afraid she's not in.	When will she be in?
What the fuck are you doing here?	Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.	Why'd you come here?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.	Yes.  It's regrettable
Yes.  It's regrettable	Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.	What for?  You need to stay busy?
What for?  You need to stay busy?	I like to know why things happen.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.	I don't think the dead much care.
I don't think the dead much care.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	Are you a believer, then?
You know of him?	I saw him in Vegas once.
I saw him in Vegas once.	Are you a gambling man?
Are you a gambling man?	When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.	Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.	What's the difference?
What's the difference?	Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.	Maybe I just bought it.
Maybe I just bought it.	Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
We've never met.	Then what do you want?
Then what do you want?	I'm here to offer you a job.
It's one in the afternoon.	What are you, my mother?
What's her problem?	She has no real grip on reality.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.	A Mister Quaid?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.	Yeah.  You could say that.
Are they all in the business?	It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
You know Vinovich?	Sure.  Vivovich.
Can you do it?	I don't know.
This is where we killed him.	You didn't try hard enough.
You didn't try hard enough.	I can't... I can't go any further...
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?	At a guess... they just resurrected him.
That's where we're all going.	In my time, and nobody else's.
He's better off this way.	Nobody's better off this wav!
Nobody's better off this wav!	You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
They got here before us.	Looks that way.
You think I'm an asshole.	Didn't know you read minds.
So Nix won't come looking for her?	It's me betrayed him.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.	Or murdered, like Nix.
Or murdered, like Nix.	He deserved it.
Look, Ma, no wires.	You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.	How the fuck do you do that?
How the fuck do you do that?	Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.	I don't think so.  You need me alive.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.	Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
I got to go.  I'm late.	Call me tomorrow.
Call me tomorrow.	There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.	Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.	A couple of weeks.
Maybe... I... don't...	What about Philip Swann?
What about Philip Swann?	I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
You could still help me do that.	Why would I want to?
Why would I want to?	Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.	You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Bob, it's me.	Oh, hi, Elaine.
You'll do it?	Yeah, I'll stay.
Why are you crying?	I'll miss you.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?	Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.	That'd be great.
I'm going to miss you.	That's what you said the other night.
That's what you said the other night.	Well, I mean it more now.
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.	I don't want to be.
It's bad isn't it?	We should get you to the doctor.
We should get you to the doctor.	You think so?
You think so?	Yeah, look at that thing.
It's for my daughter.	How old is she?
You made it.	They really have to work on that street name thing.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.	No, yes, it does...
No, yes, it does...	Yeah? But look at you.
And marriage, does that get easier?	It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.	Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Did that help? Did you learn anything?	We established that we have no communication.
That's too scary.	When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.	No one ever tells you that...
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?	"I don't know. My fax said ""have a good fright""."
Ok, whatever you want.	Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?	No, I was looking at you.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.	Oh, for her show?
Oh, for her show?	No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
Did I scowl at you?	No, you smiled.
No, you smiled.	I don't remember.
I don't remember.	I know, I kind of blend in here.
No, its easy.	How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?	I don't know.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.	I see them every morning.
I don't want to go home.	I know. I don't either.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.	I know, it's stupid.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?	Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?	No, how about you?
No, how about you?	Not really. How long are you here for?
Not really. How long are you here for?	I'm here for the week.

I couldn't hear you. How are you?	Fine. Is it going ok?
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.	It's just carpet.
It's just carpet.	That's not what I'm talking about.
That's not what I'm talking about.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Is there anything I can do?
Ok, well... I love you.	I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
I miss you.	It'll just be a few days.
Are you sure you want to stay?	Are you sure you have to go?
Oh, the record company sent these...	Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.	I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.	You don't have to be embarrassed.
You don't have to be embarrassed.	I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.	It's ok if you are.
Will you please stop smoking?	But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.	Its bad for you.
Its bad for you.	Ok, I will... later.
Do you think it's done?	I don't know.
I don't know what to do.	That's ok, you'll figure it out.
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.	You wanna come?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.	Why do you have to defend her?
It's amazing  there!	Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.	No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
John! What are you doing here?	I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?	Promoting that action movie I did...
I don't know.  What are they?	I found them in your file box.
I found them in your file box.	Must be a spare set.
Must be a spare set.	I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.	I'm just temporarily off my game.
I'm just temporarily off my game.	You need to believe in something besides yourself.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.	I believe in you.
I'm still shaking.	I can't believe Will killed him.
I can't believe Will killed him.	Thank God he did.
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.	When did they find her?
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?	Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...	I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
You never said anything to me...	It's probably trivial.
I missed you.	Do you think they have a room here?
What time did you make it for?	Eight.  That okay?
...you wearing a watch, Father?	Yes.  It's exactly...
And how would you describe him?	Quiet.  Real quiet...
Your court order, Dr. Allen.	You know I'm not comfortable with this.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.	But your patient is legally entitled to it.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.	This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.	It's the patient's request, doctor.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.	You heard voices, you know you did.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.	What did you hear?
You'll do it?	I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.	You have a sister in New Orleans.
Is he going to be okay?	I hope so.
What is it?	Something he said, just before...
Something he said, just before...	He spoke to you?
He spoke to you?	Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Father, please don't die.	...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?	Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.	"What do you mean ""don't worry?"""
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.	Father, I'm right here.
Father, I'm right here.	...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.	Just open the door, please.
Two negatives always make a positive.	Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.	Well I know he's come here before.
Well I know he's come here before.	What's his name?
You just call?	I didn't know what else to do...
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.	Kelson, hold on a second...
How much time do we have?	Not a lot.
He was trying to tell me something.	"And his message was  ""Together, no matter what?"""
Plenty of time.	What are these?
What are these?	I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
No oxygen to the brain.	Maybe that's my problem.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.	What about after?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.	We're going to do this.
We're going to do this.	You have to say that.
Are you alright?	Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.	What do you mean?
There's nothing else here.	What's the bible for?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.	That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
We needed to know all we could.	I'm going to look around.
What are you looking for exactly?	The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?	I had to.
So what'd I miss?	You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
So...what did you think of the tape.	I think you gave me the wrong one.
I think you gave me the wrong one.	What do you mean?
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.	Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.	And also that...

Mom's going to hate it.	Always on my ass, anyway.
Always on my ass, anyway.	Like you don't give her a hard time.
Like you don't give her a hard time.	Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
You shoot like a girl.	I'll take that as a compliment.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.	So how's the job going?
I know.  But chances are...	Chances are there's still a chance.
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.	And what am I supposed to say to the man?

Shouldn't you be lying down, or...	I'm alright.  But you can sit.

I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.	Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Give me the ball.	My court, I go first.
So how about a little one-on-one?	What are we playing for?
You do see me standing here, right?	I can't be nice to a fan?
I can't help girls coming up to me.	I said fine.
What was that about?	I know, right?
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?	None of your business.
With a jacked-up attitude.	Didn't know you cared so much.
That's it, give it your best shot.	Would you watch the damn road?

You do act different.	I don't care.
So...does it hurt?	It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.

He seeks redemption.	You're a fool!
So what has changed?	Perhaps he serves a different king.
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.	Hold your goblet with two fingers.
Now.  You were saying?	But -- what is he doing?
But -- what is he doing?	About to hang himself, I should think.
But -- what is Porthos doing?	Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
You grow fond of him.  That's good.	Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
How is he?	Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!	I have it all worked out.

Mother of God!	It is also a place of burial.
It is also a place of burial.	A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?	Catacombs.  Very holy.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.	Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Where are you going?	To kill the king.
Get out of my way.	Athos, I beg you --
The room of the King's favorite mistress?	She will be at the ball.

Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?	Out directing the search for the traitors.

Exactly why it should be given away.	What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Shall I leave?	No, you may wait behind the screen.
You are beautiful.  You know you are.	Sire, I --

Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?	Did you start out area six?
Let's roll -	Right behind you.
What did the six-toes have to say?	Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.

Both at the same bank...	And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
I've got a better idea...	OK...where do you want to start?
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -	They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Holy shit -	Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?	Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!

No.  It wasn't like that!	Then what did you do, play canasta?
Don't you guys ever knock?	Where is he?
What about him?	I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
That was Peterson upstairs.	It was you who did the asking.
It was you who did the asking.	He doesn't think you run mind games on him.

Could he handle a direct contact?	I don't recommend it.

I have to.	You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?	Because it's his bad luck to be special.

Can you give me an idea of the conditions...	Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.	What's being photographed?

We'll need a search running.	It's already begun.
Then the informant is real.	Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.	He'll be contacting us again.
He'll be contacting us again.	Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?	Their next target.  The name is Neo.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.	And you are?
And you are?	Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.	You all look the same to me.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.	No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
That's the third white van I've seen.	Should Tank I.D. it?
He's gonna make it.	No way.  Not possible.
You're two hours late.	I know.  It's her fault.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?	He had an accident.
There's something about him, isn't there?	Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Are you sure this line is clean?	Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.	You don't, do you?
You weren't supposed to relieve me.	I know but I felt like taking a shift.
How many were there?	Five.  Since I've been here.
Five.  Since I've been here.	What happened to them?
What happened to them?	Dead.  All dead.
No, it's all right.	What are you doing?
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!	He's going to pop!
I got you.	Just get me outta here.
Just get me outta here.	Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
What is he doing?	He's beginning to believe.
Give me your phone.	They'll be able to track it.
They'll be able to track it.	We have no choice.
I got a fibrillation!	Shit!  Apoc?
And you still believe I'm the One?	Yes I do.
Of the Resistance.	And she knows what?  Everything?
And she knows what?  Everything?	She would say she knows enough.
She would say she knows enough.	How does she know?
What did she tell you?	That I would find the One.
Set down in there.	What's going on?
Do you understand, Neo?	I think I do.
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?	The body cannot live without the mind.
I thought it wasn't real.	Your mind makes it real.
Do you know why you didn't make it?	Because... I didn't think I would?
How did I beat you?	You -- you're too fast.
Right now, we're inside a computer program?	Wild, isn't it?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?	More important than what is when?
Why do my eyes hurt?	You've never used them before.
What are you doing?	Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
... am I dead?	Far from it.
This can't be...	Be what?  Be real?
It's an honor.	Please.  Come.  Sit.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.	The agents --
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.	How do you know all this?
The cubicle across from you is empty.	But what if...?
But what if...?	Go!  Now!
Who's coming for me?	Stand up and see for yourself.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!	We need an exit.
We need an exit.	Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.	We're on our way --
How is he?	Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.	I'm not the One.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.	You're the Oracle?
Are you all right?	I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
What are you doing?	I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you.	No, you're not.
What are you doing?	I'm going in after him.
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!	There has to be something that we can do.
Is Morpheus alive?	Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
We can't leave him!	We have to!
What did you just say?	Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.	What happened?  What did you see?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?	It might have been.  I'm not sure.
Are you all right?	... right as rain.
What did she tell you?	She told me...
What does that mean?	That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.	But an Oracle can.
Are you worried?	Should I be?
Get this thing out of me!	Easy, Neo.  Easy.
What is this thing?	We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
What the hell is this?!	It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
Who are you?	My name is Trinity.
I just thought... you were a guy.	Most guys do.
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!	Neo, this has to be done!
What are they doing to him?	They're hacking his mind.
What just happened?	I don't know.  I lost him.
What the hell just happened?	An Agent!  You have to send me back!
There is.  We have to pull the plug.	You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!	Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
Tank, you're hurt.	I'll be all right.
We need an exit!	You're not far from Cypher.
You're not far from Cypher.	Cypher, I thought --
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.	Let go of her.

No, she's got epilepsy.	Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
Uncle, how are you feeling?	Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?	About that shooting last night...I was there and...
About that shooting last night...I was there and...	No you weren't.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.	What was it?
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...	Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
You know why...with my parents.	Well you can't blame them in a way.
Well you can't blame them in a way.	I can take care of myself.  You know that.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.	I know...I know.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.	You're intolerable today.
You're intolerable today.	Watch your language.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.	Take your time.  I don't care.
Take your time.  I don't care.	I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.	That's the word...preoccupied.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...	What is it now?
Sure...it's not that...I mean...	It's all right.
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?	Maybe, who knows.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.	Do you have enough?
What's the matter with this kid?	I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.	The girls like it loud.
The girls like it loud.	Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.	I know...I know.

You mean it's heisted.	You could say that.
You could say that.	This is a heisted car!
Hey... you got stereo.	Yeah, I think so.
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?	Sal!... fourteen street.
This is some boat.  Your father's?	Yeah...just had it delivered...
Just keep him quiet.	Friends of yours Michael.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?	Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.	Can you spare it?
Dinner?  Again?	Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Look who's talking.	Yeah, speak for yourself.
-- But he does seem very nice.	You think so?
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.	Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.	Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Just plain 'Joe'?	Love that name.
Daddy!  Come on, a name.	Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
I haven't been the father to you that --	That you've been to Susan?
That you've been to Susan?	I wasn't going to say --
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?	They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
What is this?	Annie made them.
I don't like cake.	It's for the party, Dad --
It's for the party, Dad --	Oh, the goddam party --
From the Korean War.	Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
I know you do, darling.	And you could care less --
I hate parties --	Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Hi, Allison --	Have you got a minute?
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.	But it's your birthday.
What about the Mayor?	He said he would be there with bells on.
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.	Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.	Red or white?
What do you do that for?	Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
What are you eating.	You mean this, sir?
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.	Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.	So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
...See you tomorrow night.	Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.	You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.	He'll wait --
You're taking this too far, Drew.	Am I not obligated to?
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.	-- And now you're going to pee some more.
Perhaps you could remind me.	I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
What an odd pairing.	It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
It doesn't matter.	Then why did you bring it up?
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?	Why yes, thank you.
Why yes, thank you.	Hot or cold.
And what do I get?	You get not to go to jail.
In English, please.	Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --	The answer is no, quick enough for you?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?	Don't you want to hear the details?
I think it's time you went home, Drew.	Certainly.  Goodnight.
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.	I thought this was practically a done deal --
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.	How nice for you both.
Shall we adjourn?	But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
I am now.	Glad I could be of some help.
Have we met?	Uh -- he's from out of town --
Is there any more to it?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
Like a marriage made in heaven?	You have a way with words.
It's going to be great --	Do you think I need a haircut?
Do you think I need a haircut?	Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --	Did you just hear something?
Did you just hear something?	Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --	No no, not you.
In my sleep.	What'd it say?
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.	He said that?
He said that?	Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.	Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
I'm going to put a stop to this!	Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.	But I didn't mean to do it!
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?	He was interested.
He was interested.	-- But he was concerned about the timing?
'It's up to Joe'?	That's what he said.
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.	Yeah.  Neat.
'It's up to Joe', huh?	Yeah, that's what he said.
Yeah, that's what he said.	Well, that's very interesting.
Well, I guess he's found one.	Joe, you do get around.
You're overthinking it --	I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
She knows you real self?	She knows how she feel.
No, I come to see Doctor.	Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Not time yet.	Make it time.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.	Make it go 'way.
Make it go 'way.	Doctor lady make it irey.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.	What you then?
What you then?	I from dat nex' place.
No, no.  I on holiday.	Some spot you pick.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.	Good morning, Jennifer.
Good morning, Jennifer.	The Board is waiting.
You think so?  How do you know?	Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.	Confused, huh?  About what?
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.	You love Allison, don't you?
You love Allison, don't you?	Oh yes, I do.
Oh yes, I do.	How did you meet?
Don't bother asking, we already tried.	It's so very nice to see you again.
How long you here, Joe?	As long as it takes.
You think so?	Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
I love you now, I'll love you always --	Hold me --
The 'coffee shop' --	-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
What will we do?	'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'.	'Love will find out the way'?
'Love will find out the way'?	It's a saying.
It's a saying.	I believe that, don't you?
I believe that, don't you?	Yes, that's why I said it.
We know so little about each other --	We know all that we need to know --
We know all that we need to know --	But there's so much to tell you --
But there's so much to tell you --	Don't.  That will come later.
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.	It gets worse.
Well -- I --	And you can't tell me who you are.
I like you in a black tie.	I love you in an evening gown.
I love you in an evening gown.	It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
Where are you going?	Nowhere?  I'm...here.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.	For how long?
For how long?	Oh, I hope a long, long time.
Did you like making love to me?	I loved it.
I loved it.	More than you love peanut butter?
He's taking a nap.	He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --	Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
-- Could you?	Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?	Why, yes.  Thank you.
I love your smell.	-- I guess you haven't.
I'm sorry about --	Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.	I am, too.
I am, too.	Has her pain abated?
It comforts you, doesn't it?	Yes...I've found that it does.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?	I don't know.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --	I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I mean I appreciate that.	And I appreciate you, too.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --	Be sorry for nothing.
Oh goodness, no.	Then why are you here, Joe?
Then why are you here, Joe?	I came to see you.
Very well, I'll watch.	Watch me do what?
Watch me do what?	Whatever you do.
Whatever you do.	That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --	And I'll be a visitor.
And I'll be a visitor.	Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.	I don't mind --
-- What kind of childhood did you have?	Do you love Drew?
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?	No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I've got plenty of friends.	I don't have any.
I don't have any.	I can see why.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --	An offense --
An offense --	An indictable offense.
I told you to shut up.	Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --	He is --
He is --	I'll take it from here --  I am --
I'll take it from here --  I am --	-- An IRS man.
Joe, don't do this --	It's time to put this person where he belongs.
I don't like what you're saying.	I don't expect you to.
I don't expect you to.	Are you threatening me?
Those were my words, Bill.	Well, they're mine now.
What the hell do you care?	I was just asking, Bill.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.	I told you, 'watch it'.
I'll be the judge of that.	I'm her father!
I'm her father!	With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
I couldn't sleep.	I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm not hungry.	Then I can't help you.
Why did you go to the hospital?	I don't know.
I don't know.	You were just curious?
I wouldn't put it that way.	What way would you put it?
What way would you put it?	You tell me, Bill.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --	This part I'm interested in.
Why didn't you stop me?	Well...I don't know.
Excellent.  What is it?	Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Are you going to eat your lunch	It's all yours.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.	No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Now I'd like to be alone.	Oh.  Okay.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.	Are you sad, Bill?
What's it like?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	What's it like where I'm going?
What's it like where I'm going?	Can you keep a secret?
That's what everybody says.	I'm not everybody.
I'm not everybody.	That's what everybody says.
How about giving a guy a break?	Make an exception?
Make an exception?	There's one to every rule.
What do you mean?	You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?	I guess so.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.	Sounds fair enough.
Sounds fair enough.	It is a deal?
Good morning, Bill.	How are you?  How're you feeling?
How are you?  How're you feeling?	'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Well, thank you for letting me know.	Not at all.
Not at all.	And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.	Good night to you, Bill.
How long have I got?	You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
What a good idea.	Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
It just occurred to me --	Speak up, please.
You want me to be your guide --?	You fill the bill, Bill.
You fill the bill, Bill.	I do?  How long will you be staying?
I do?  How long will you be staying?	You should hope quite a while.
You should hope quite a while.	And then --?
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?	I am not a dream.
The 'question' --	Yes, Bill.  The question.
Where are you?  Are you there?	It's enough now.
It's enough now.	Please.  Talk to me --
Please.  Talk to me --	There's going to be plenty of time for that.
There's going to be plenty of time for that.	What do you mean?!
What do you mean?!	I think you know --
I think you know --	Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
Are you giving me orders?	I'm sorry, I --
What are you talking about?	What you were talking about.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.	I didn't ask any question.
I didn't ask any question.	I believe you did.
You think Drew will go for it?	Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Quince, I've got confidence in you.	Sir, I'll deliver the package.
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?	Yeah, I give a shit.
Yeah, I give a shit.	See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
Hi, Bill --	Good morning, Quince.
Good morning, Quince.	How're you doing--?
How're you doing--?	I'm doing great.  You ready?
I'm doing great.  You ready?	I am, this is it.  B Day.
I am, this is it.  B Day.	How's that, Quince?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.	"Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings"" shit."
What was that?	The fireworks are about to start.
I love you, Daddy --	That's why it's okay.
Are you relieved?	Yes, but --
What a night.	I'm having a helluva time.
Where's he going?	I don't know, I can't say --
Where is he?	I don't know.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.	Then what is it?
That was wonderful.	Yeah, it's good to get together.
Yeah, it's good to get together.	Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?	Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.	Yer damn right.
Daddy, what's the matter?	Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Don't get carried away.	Uh oh --
Well, I wasn't going to say that --	What were you going to say?
Do you love Drew?	You mean like you loved Mom?
...There's a start for a meeting.	I know it's none of my business --
I thought you were in a meeting--?	I am.  With you.
Not my birthday again?	You're only six-five once.
How did you know?	Drew told me.
Drew told me.	Does Drew tell you everything?
Does Drew tell you everything?	I hope so.
I hope so.	You like him, don't you?
You like him, don't you?	Yeah.  I guess so.
...We know so little about each other.	But we've got time.
I've got to go --	Did I say something wrong?
Did I say something wrong?	No, it was so right it scares me.
Not at all.	How 'bout another cup of coffee?
How 'bout another cup of coffee?	I've got patients coming in --
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?	I could be her.
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.	Not at all.  It was fascinating.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.	Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?	You and 'Honey'?
Well, what then?	It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...	That's right I did, didn't I?
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.	Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.	You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

That's it! That's the reason!	I don't know.
I don't know.	No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
But why would a man need more than one woman?	I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
A miracle. Well, that's news.	My mother's recovered.

Which one of us is she flirting with?	The good-looking one.

You know what I mean.	I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Seventy a year.	Not bad, not bad.
Not bad, not bad.	How about yourself?

No doubt you've heard the rumors.	I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.	My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?	I don't think I've had that pleasure.

What did you say?	I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?

Do you know who you address, sir?	Whom you address.
Whom you address.	The future King!
Convey her a message.	She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
It's the Queen's decision.	I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?	It is quite late enough.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?	No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?	It's so infernally cold in here.
It's so infernally cold in here.	Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
Checked and locked, sir.	Back and upper corridors.
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.	Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.

I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.	Don't think I can't persuade her.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.	That can wait till the weekend.
That can wait till the weekend.	There are important papers from --

I need a man who knows where I am.	I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.	That's not good enough.
I promised to protect her from people like you.	For once in my life, I am not the issue.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.	She'll never understand it.
She'll never understand it.	In time, she will.
In time, she will.	She'll think I betrayed her.
They aren't as watchful as you.	Too busy looking after themselves.
Too busy looking after themselves.	The greasy pole.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.	She trusts you, John.
What I do, I do for my Queen.	Was there never ambition?
I do what I do.	For Her Majesty.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?	I said.  I serve the Queen.
I said.  I serve the Queen.	No other aspiration?
What do you know about the Highlands?	I am a blank sheet.
I am a blank sheet.	Do you hunt?
Dare say you can be taught.	To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.

Then why send me back to them?!	Because I have to!
Am I not safe enough with you, John?	Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.	The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.	I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Must they always follow us?	I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
What is it, John?  John?	I heard something.
We took a nip of whiskey.	To keep out the cold.
They're ready now.	I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
"I am thinking of publishing my ""Highland Journals."""	Are they worth reading?
Are they worth reading?	I am told so.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.	What does he know about the Highlands?
What does he know about the Highlands?	He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.	That doesn't make him an expert.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.	He thought so, yes.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.	And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.	I'm glad of it.
And the pony?	She's well, too.
What can we do?	Oh, several things.
I came as quickly as I could.	You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?	I beg your pardon?
Then they may read about me.	Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.	Is that not enough?
We're going to lose.	You can't know that for sure.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.	What's her excuse this time?
What did he want?	To know when he'll be king.
I see the Prince of Wales is here.	I hope he got his mother's permission.
Should we take it seriously?	The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
The question is, do we need her?	Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.	Dear oh dear.
I'm sorry, ma'am?	Cold is good!
How long has he been this sick?	A few days, ma'am.
A few days, ma'am.	Why was I not told earlier?
I understand he was in a fight.	Has he been hurt?
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.	What is he doing there?
What is he doing there?	He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
There is one other matter.	What is it?
What is it?	I have a letter, ma'am.
Who told them that?	I have no idea.
We were expecting you to return by six.	And now I am back.
Please make sure it does not happen again.	Of course, at once.
Where is my son?	Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.	Why is he not here?
Why is he not here?	He is sick, ma'am.
He is sick, ma'am.	Then why are you not with him?
What is the matter with him?	He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Could you play ARCADE with that?	"Well, technically ""yes"", but this is only the prototype."
What's the riddle?	If I tell you, then it's no fun.
If I tell you, then it's no fun.	Just tell me the fucking riddle.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.	And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
We're having some problems with ARCADE...	Yeah, who isn't.
Talk to me.	There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
Now what seems to be the problem?	It's the game, ARCADE.
It's the game, ARCADE.	You don't like it?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?	How'd you know it was us?
What's her problem?	Did you play ARCADE last night?
"He thinks I'm ""sublimating""."	What the hell does that mean?
We can't reach that!	We don't have a choice!
Our time's up.	What?!  There's nothing here!
Which way do you think Level Two is?	You've got the schematics, check.
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.	Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.	That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?	One.  In case...
One.  In case...	Don't even say it.
You feel it?  It's different this time.	We're actually inside, aren't we?
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.	I know.  It sucks.
You're not coming, Alex.	Yes I am...
You mean we learn the rules...	And beat it at it's own game.

Have you ever kissed anyone?	Like they do on TV?
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.	But, I don't know how.
But, I don't know how.	Here, practice on your arm like this.

They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.	We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.	Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.	I told you i'll get in trouble.
Who's that with your Dad?	It's my mother.

I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!	Hi Mr. Bixler!
Hey look at this, no feet!	Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
I knew he wouldn't come.	I can't, I have to go home.
You don't miss much.	Part of being a New Yorker.
I should look different.	You should look like you dressed yourself.
Yeah, it's in the contract.	Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.	Oh, you're more than okay.
You're going to say it, aren't you?	Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.	I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I'm moving this book to Viking.	Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
I suppose it's too late to start over.	It's too late to start over.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...	I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Someday she'll thank you.	Let's not get carried away.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...	You've been working on this, huh?
I was devastated.	Go figure you.
You like her.	If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...	When I'm talking to children.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.	I can see why.
You have a real philosophy of life.	It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
We'll never be the same.	I have a suggestion...
I have a suggestion...	I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
He can't do that to me!	We're about to find out.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.	Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
I never want to go through this again.	That's entirely understandable.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?	Have you ever heard of. Irony?
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...	I love him.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?	Don't you see...
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?	This must be... very, very, hard on him.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.	What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...	They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...	He won't get mad, huh?
He'll see right through it.	Only.  If he wants to.
For the twins? What in the world is th...	Gold nose hair clippers.
But he always says...	... whatever is manly and independent.
About Michael's job.	Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...	I just think you're wrong, is all.
I just think you're wrong, is all.	Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
Stop, we're embarrassing h...	... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
And the answer was so simple.	I was gonna predict that.
And loving him means loving all of this.	Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?	So it's sweet of you to be protective...
So it's sweet of you to be protective...	Let me rephrase that...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...	... except one.
He sucks soup through his front teeth.	A trademark move, don't touch it.
A trademark move, don't touch it.	But he sure can kiss.
But he sure can kiss.	It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
What else did he tell you...	... you hate weddings, you never go.
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.	Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...	... you want a menage on your wedding night.
But I can't be dry.	Can you watch the road?
Can you watch the road?	See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
I saw the show.	... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?	Nobody has.  So far.
I think he's been fired.	It doesn't say th...
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.	Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I never forgot that.	It's two weeks.
Why would she come here...	This is where I proposed.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...	I came here, looking for her.
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...	... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.	ARE YOU CRAZY?
... your one chance for true happiness?	... yeah, that.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.	Well, it happens.
I asked you...	She admits it's her fault.
This is her family and her fault.	And your point?
And your point?	Well.  How come she didn't...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?	Get married, apparently.
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.	If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.	A bad combination.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.	"""Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."""
This thing means that much to y...	It means a lot.
I'm up against a deadline.	Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.	That's my point!!
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...	We danced to it.  Just like this.
Where did we first hear th...	The night we met.
Dance card filled?	I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.	Except for that.
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.	You've been the man in mine.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...	It's more than that.
Don't you throw up on boat?	If you like.
You miss her, huh?	No.  I've got you.
Big weddings are so strange.	You keep saying that.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.	Like I said, dazzling.
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?	Never can tell.
You're not eating.	I never eat when I'm serene.
I never eat when I'm serene.	You never eat when you're despondent.
You never eat when you're despondent.	I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...	That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.	What, leaving school...
Should I whistle down a cab?	Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...	She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.	Waiter! Check, please!
Waiter! Check, please!	"She finds him ""personable."""
"She finds him ""personable."""	Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
Every day.  She makes the bed.	Quite the little eccentric.
Well, maybe we should talk ab...	I need you.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...	You've met her parents.
And to m...	... and you knew about this.
It's not just a gag, huh?	No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.	You're much more his type.

Where're you going to go?	When I get set, I'll send for you.
When I get set, I'll send for you.	I don't think that'll happen.
Ain't you goin' to say something?	There's nothing to say.
There's nothing to say.	Well, that'll be the first time.
Duff, I love you.	Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
What d'you mean?	Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
How come you don't hate their guts?	I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.	You were plenty scared that night in the car.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.	Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
No point fixin' it!	What're you going to do?
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.	What about your boy?
What about your boy?	How come you keep askin'?
How come you keep askin'?	I keep thinking about him.
I keep thinking about him.	Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.	We'll be all right.
Don't look so scared.	You jivin' me?
You jivin' me?	Well, I haven't come around.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!	I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt you.	Go on - hit me!
My kids want me to teach them.	Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
What about them?	Am I as good as they?
Am I as good as they?	Hmmm - good coffee.
Hmmm - good coffee.	You didn't answer my question.
You didn't answer my question.	Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.	You still didn't answer my question.
You still didn't answer my question.	Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
Everything you cook is good.	Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Smells like something crawled in there and died.	Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.	Come here, baby.
Is that so?	Yeah, that's so.
What about him?	He could live with us.
Don't call them that.	That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
I can see why.	Well, what d'you think?
How about it?	What happened, Duff?
What d'you mean?	Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
Okay, I guess.	I'll have some coffee, please.
What's he like?	I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.	I'm just going in to do my shopping.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.	Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
I'll see you later.	Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence.
Ain't your fault.	That's the way he is.
That's the way he is.	Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.	What d'you mean?
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.	Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.	Just for the day?
Just for the day?	Goin' to see my kid.
Goin' to see my kid.	I didn't know you had one.
I didn't know you had one.	Yeah. Well, I do.
Yeah. Well, I do.	Are you married?
Are you married?	No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
Why did you?	I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.

What d'you mean?	You almost got into trouble back there.
You almost got into trouble back there.	I wouldn't have let you.
No, on the porch.	Oh yeah, and then what?
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.	Good night, Duff.
Let's go, Duff.	Take it easy.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.	Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.	I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?	That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.	How d'you mean?
How d'you mean?	Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.	I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.	Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.	What d'you expect?
What d'you expect?	You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.	How d'you mean?
How d'you mean?	Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?	Well, that's a funny thing to say.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.	You keep asking me why I'm here.
You keep asking me why I'm here.	Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.	I like a place with lots of life.
I like a place with lots of life.	How about another beer?
You work around town?	I'm a teacher.

Oh yeah? That's my home town.	Your folks live there?
Your folks live there?	No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?

Haven't seen you around, have I?	No. I'm new in town.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.	You must be new in town.
You must be new in town.	I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.	What 'you signifyin'?
What 'you signifyin'?	I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
We was just leavin', fellows.	Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Just get her drunk.	How 'bout the key?
How 'bout the key?	I bet she's easy jam.
What's so hot 'round town?	Take it easy, Frankie.
What you gettin' all pretty for?	Why don't you relax, Frankie?
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.	What's eatin' you, Jocko?
See you, Duff.	Yeah, see you in hell.
Couldn't get the words out before.	Better get him to a hospital.
Better get him to a hospital.	Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
I asked you somethin', boy!	I heard you.
I heard you.	Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
I said, I come to town with a girl.	Plannin' on getting married?
Wouldn't have known you.	Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.	What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?	Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.	Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?	Yeah. That's right.
She don't look no worse to me.	Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.	Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.	What did you say, boy?!
What did you say, boy?!	I said, she's in great shape.
No thanks, Lee.	It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Well, what're you going to do?	I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.	Going back, huh?
They'll run you out.	No, they won't.
No, they won't.	How 'you gonna live?
Don't be too hard on him.	Hell, I'm just like him.
Hell, I'm just like him.	I know he wasn't much of a father.
Come on, Pop.	Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Come back some other time, will you?	Yeah, sure. Good luck.
How often does he get like that?	Whenever he's got an edge on.
Whenever he's got an edge on.	How often is that?
So I been told.	It's for your own good.
I guess I'll rob a bank.	Don't you get smart with me, boy.
I guess I ain't.	Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Guess it's never been easy.	It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
How are you?	All right, son.
'Musta knocked her up.	What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
Well, if it ain't Duff!	How you doin'?  Hi there!
Why don't you guys buy your own?	'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.	What d'you know about women, Pop?
What d'you know about women, Pop?	Well, I got married to one of them.
Well, I got married to one of them.	Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.	Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
I'll talk to the Mayor.	That'll make the folks very happy.
Got a thick feelin' here.	What's the matter now?
What's the matter now?	Better now.  Where 'you at?
Now you stay put!	I ain't drunk, honey.
I ain't drunk, honey.	Like hell you ain't!
He's your son.	Okay, boy, beat it.
Come on, Will.	What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Let's stay here, Will.	What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
We got any shots?	Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
How long's it been?	I'm still on my honeymoon.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?	No. I only needed the code from you.
No. I only needed the code from you.	Then we would have talked, you and I.
What the hell is that?	Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?	Straylight. Kitchen dock.
Can you get us into Straylight?	Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
What are you doing in here?	The Elders, mon...
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.	They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.	I find out now.
You've got your orders.	This ain't Bangkok, chief.
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.	You see the couple up in the balcony?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.	You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.	Did you trace it?
Did you trace it?	No, but it traced me.
You ran without us.	I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?	What are you talking about?
Why'd you do it, Armitage?	The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.	Good, because you've got a new one.
An odd selection, Mr Case.	I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
You're pleasant tonight.	Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
I saw your girl yesterday.	I don't have a girl.
I don't have a girl.	No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?	Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...	Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?	Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.	Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?	Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Yeah. That was me.	Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.	As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.	Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?	That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Four men. Babylon soldiers.	Can you walk?
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.	The girl 3Jane. We need her.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.	This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?	All things possible in Babylon.
All things possible in Babylon.	Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
What about the route to the core?	I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
How's the ice?	One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
You haven't got it?	I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
How much time you got left?	Less than thirty minutes.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.	You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
Where the hell have you been?	We got problems topside.
You can make your move when it comes after me.	What are you talkin' about?
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.	It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Bright enough to be dangerous.	That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
Can you take me to it?	Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
Who got you into this?	A guy who calls himself Armitage.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.	Never heard of him.
What about the mainframe's access code?	3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
Case... are you okay?	I don't know. I don't know...
My God... these people are insane.	Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
We've still got to find the mainframe.	No we don't...
Is he going to make it?	Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
He projects with neural implants.	That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.	For Peter, that's a short trip.
Something exotic I hope.	Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
Case... Are you alright?	Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be okay.	So... did you get a look at heaven?
I'll get the car.	They'll cut you down.
Case... it's four a.m.	I don't sleep much. You packed?
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.	Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.	It sounds like you.
It sounds like you.	Put the gun down, Case.
On a good run... yeah.	So you're a wire junkie.
I'm going in.	You're not ready yet. They said two days.
That's not going to help.	The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
How soon is soon enough?	Couple of days. They'll examine you.
How long have I been out?	Almost two days.
Couple of months.	What about before that?
What about before that?	For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.	Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
Maybe something's onto him.	What's that supposed to mean?
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.	Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.	Why should I want to meet him.
How are you at riddles, Peter?	What are you talking about?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?	uhh, must have forgotten-
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.	Yeah, I know.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?	No Roger from op/ed?
Well excuse me.	"What about the ""Roaring Twenties"" or ""The 80's""?"
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?	Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?	Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.	You need my help?
You need my help?	No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Now this is cute.	That is lingerie.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.	Anita, remember espadrilles?
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.	Okay. That's bad.
"My own undercover feature - ""Written by Josie Geller""."	Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.	Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Guess who I did it with last night...	Roger in Op/Ed.
George! What are you doing here?	Just get in the van, Josie.
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.	Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.

You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.	It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--	He's my teacher!
Do you even know these kids?	They hid my car--
It's an expose on cafeteria food.	And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.	But I don't want it straightened out.
But I don't want it straightened out.	Geller, this is way out of your league.
You've done five of my ideas.	You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?	They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?	A flack jacket.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.	So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.

Better than I...	That's the spirit!
Is that true?	Little known fact.
No, I mean, no big whoop.	I can't do this.
Do you remember high school?	It was a long time ago -
It was a long time ago -	Don't you remember what they called you?
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!	Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
That is so--weird that you name your car.	No it's not. Guys name their penises.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.	Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.	She just needs a new windshield wiper.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.	I finally found my story.
Please. Please don't walk away.	I just can't look at you the same way.

Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.	When are you going to open your eyes?
When are you going to open your eyes?	I'm thinking when I'm home.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.	I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.	You have to say that. You're my student.
You have to say that. You're my student.	I don't have to say that.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.	You remember that story?

So what are you thinking for college?	College. Haven't really thought about it.
College. Haven't really thought about it.	That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
You like her?	I love the way she writes.
You ruined the whole thing!	You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Josie, you look Rufus.	Who are you guys?

Not at all!	We can handle it.
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.	Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.

We're not always as good at things as we'd like.	Yeah, but I was really not good.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?	I -- I think so!
What are these, beauty marks?	Those are ancient history.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.	Can't be good news coming from you.
Can't be good news coming from you.	Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
I don't know...	It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
Max, where's Kristen?	She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.	Why is that?
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.	I've heard crazier things this week.
Who would know where they were hidden?	There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
We can try again.	Everybody take five.
You sound like Peter Pan.	Remember -- open mind.
Remember -- open mind.	Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
This is nice.	Never been here before?
Never been here before?	Must have opened while I was away at school.
Sounds like a rough time.	It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?	I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
Didn't get much sleep.	Well, we've got --
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.	So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.	Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.	What's that supposed to mean?
Okay, straight talk only in here.	What about Kristen?
What about Kristen?	We can't get to her.  I've tried.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?	Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.	You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
Somebody else is out here.	No.  We're alone.
We've got work to do.	What are you talking about?
How do we get in?	They used to keep a spare key.
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?	You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?	I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Why is he after us?	Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.	This is stupid.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?	I'm a vegetarian.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?	Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.	Now you're lying.
Wait a minute.  What about me?	I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?	Well... a shot at it.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'	And then I... right.
God, that's an enormous arse.	I'm not listening.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?	I'm an actress.
I thought I'd give it to you.	Thank you.  Shall I...
Thank you.  Shall I...	No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.	But... wait... there are things to say.
This is certainly... ah...	I only found out you were here yesterday.
How are you doing?	How do you think I'm doing?
How do you think I'm doing?	I don't know what happened.
You and every person in this country.	Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
You have a stunt bottom?	I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
You've got big feet.	Yes.  Always have had.
Yes.  Always have had.	You know what they say about men with big feet?
You know what they say about men with big feet?	No.  What's that?
No.  What's that?	Big feet -- large shoes.
With a goat playing a violin.	Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'	'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'	My son's name is Johnny?
Well, get a message through to him too.	Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.	What do you think?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.	Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you like me to take you through your lines?	Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.	Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.	I have thought about you.
I have thought about you.	Oh no no -- no.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.	I think goodbye is traditional.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?	There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
I don't know, I'm afraid.	I don't know either.
So who left who?	She left me.
She saw through me.	Uh-oh.  That's not good.
Yes, you did.	No, I didn't.
No, I didn't.	You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.	Why is she in a wheelchair?
Why is she in a wheelchair?	It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
Okay -- fine.	But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?	If that's all right.
Oh -- Okay.	Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Here we go.	Thanks.  Well...
Oh hi.  Forget something?	I forgot my bag.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?	I haven't decided.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?	Tempting but... no, thank you.
Can I have your autograph?	What's your name?
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.	Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Where are you going?	Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.	Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
He's bringing a girl?	Miracles do happen.
Miracles do happen.	Does the girl have a name?
Does the girl have a name?	He wouldn't say.
He wouldn't say.	Christ, what is going on in there?
This painting isn't the original, is it?	Yes, I think that one may be.
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.	Tony -- what do you think?
Still loves you though.	In a depressingly asexual way.
In a depressingly asexual way.	I never fancied you much actually...
He's cooking guinea fowl?	Don't even ask.
Bloody hell, this is fun.	Is Miss Scott staying here?
But she said she wanted to go out with you?	Yes -- sort of...
Bernie -- this is Anna.	Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Is this your first film?	No -- it's my 22nd.
No -- it's my 22nd.	Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?	Working with Leonardo.
I was called and I came.  What's up?	William has just turned down Anna Scott.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.	You daft prick!
Yes.  What do you think?	Well, yes.  Groovy.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.	What's your name?
I'll see what I can do.	Still, not sparkling.
Still, not sparkling.	Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Are you a fan of Henry James?	This is Henry James film?
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?	Ah... yes, enormously.
Ah... yes, enormously.	Well, fire away.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.	Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?	But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Martin -- your customer.	Can I help you?
That's right -- Topol.	But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.	No, well... he was quite a long way away.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.	So it could have been neither of them?
So it could have been neither of them?	I suppose so.
I suppose so.	Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?	Not classic, no.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.	Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
Oh God no.	So not over her, in fact.
So -- you've laid the ghost.	I believe I have.
I believe I have.	Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.	No, don't think I do.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?	No -- did you?
So I get the brownie?	I think you do, yes.
'No comment' means 'yes.'	No, it doesn't.
No, it doesn't.	Do you ever masturbate?
Do you ever masturbate?	Definitely no comment.
Definitely no comment.	You see -- it means 'yes.'
Max.  This is Anna.	Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
Can I help you?	Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...	Does she know you're coming?
Does she know you're coming?	No, no.  She doesn't.
No, no.  She doesn't.	I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
What's going on?	I'm going to throw out these old videos.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.	Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
No -- you're right.	I'll talk to you in the morning.
I'll talk to you in the morning.	Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.	You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?	No, 'fraid not.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'	Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.	So -- any messages?
So -- any messages?	Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.	Two?  That's it?
Two?  That's it?	You want me to write down all your messages?
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?	Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
There's something wrong with this yogurt.	It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.	Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
What are the choices?	Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
The one down your trousers.	I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Yes, Mister Harding?	Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?	No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.	But you have no proof.
But you have no proof.	No, Miss Ratched...
No, Miss Ratched...	And yet you suspect her.
And yet you suspect her.	Yes, that is correct.

Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.	Thank you, ma'am...

Arrested on an assault charge five times...	That's correct, Doc ...

Up an' at 'em, Taber.	What's going on?
What's going on?	Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.	Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!

I thought so.	Is he in an asylum?
Whew! Hiya, boys!	Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
She was your sister.	No, she wasn't my sister.
He is your husband, no?	Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
May I see your boarding pass, please?	I-- I must've misplaced it.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?	Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
So, what's the story with your friend?	My friend has lost her fucking mind...
My friend has lost her fucking mind...	What's she doing?
We found each other, didn't we?	Yes.  We did.
Yes.  We did.	It's alright...  this is our destiny.
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?	Your hair... is perfect.
Your great aunt.	What great aunt?
There is one other thing you should know about me.	Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?	Oh no.  Do you?
A very large pig.	Ask her if she knows where he is?
Ask her if she knows where he is?	Sa dov'e' lui?
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.	Wait.  I have to write this down.
Smoking or non-smoking?	Non.  Please.
Where are you going?	I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?	Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
WAIT!!  Where are you?	I'm at the airport.  Why?
I'm at the airport.  Why?	Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Hello?  Is anybody there?	Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
I was hoping for the real thing.	I brought you that, too.
"A ""little white lie""?  A ""little white lie""?"	What would you call it?
What would you call it?	I would call it-- unforgivable.
Yes.  I am.	In that case... no...
Hi.  Are you... busy?	No.  Are you're leaving?
No.  Are you're leaving?	No.  I just came by to apologize.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.	No.  Course not.
How about music?  You like classical?	The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
You were saying...	Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
What are you doing here?	We were hungry.
And she's a knock-out, too.	Well, good.  Good for you.
I'd really rather not say.	Please.  I need to know.
Does he love you?	He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?	You didn't answer my question.
You didn't answer my question.	Why are you asking me this?
Why can't you just tell me?	If it's any of your business, yes.
If it's any of your business, yes.	Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.	Are you okay?  You want some help?
How could you do this to me?	I'm in love with you.
That's not the point.	You said whatever it was you would understand.
You said whatever it was you would understand.	That was before I found out what it was.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?	A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
So what do you think?	Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
What looks good?	Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...	You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?	Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?	Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.	It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
I'll look forward to it.	Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Well, not exactly...	Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Been here long?	Just since yesterday.
He's a jerk.	Yes.  He is.
Yes.  He is.	I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.	Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
No one's perfect, Kate.	And he is living proof.
Joan Collins stayed here.	Is Damon Bradley here?
Peter found him?	Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
No.  No, you go ahead.	You sure you'll be okay?
I know, but...	It was a ouija board, remember?
It was a ouija board, remember?	...and a fortune teller.
What about Peter?...	Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Hi.  Where've you been?	Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
So, you've had a little bad luck.	A little bad luck?
That was really sweet...	I meant about my idea.
I meant about my idea.	I think it's time we got some professional help.
I think it's time we got some professional help.	Like a detective.
Like a detective.	No... Like a psychiatrist.
No... Like a psychiatrist.	Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?	Because I'm the one who's single.
Because I'm the one who's single.	I never even got to be single.
I never even got to be single.	Sure you did.
Sure you did.	Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
You think he misses me at all?	'Course he does.
You expecting somebody you know?	Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
What is it?	A phone message.  Only--
What'd you find?	A Butterfinger wrapper.
A Butterfinger wrapper.	A rich, possibly fat, slob.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.	Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
What are you doing?	He fell out.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.	We lost him?...
Are you sure?	Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.	But it's July.
But it's July.	It's still the new year...
It's still the new year...	What about your job?
What about your job?	I have vacation time coming to me.
I have vacation time coming to me.	You don't have a passport.
It's a miracle.	It's a coincidence.
Have you seen him with someone?	No...  I can just tell.
Kate, is something the matter?	Larry brought me flowers last night.
Larry brought me flowers last night.	Is that bad?...
Is that bad?...	I think he's having an affair.
No.  He's never asked me.	Why don't you ask him?
What's he do?	I don't know, Kate.
I don't know, Kate.	You don't have any idea?
You don't have any idea?	He's a podiatrist or something.
Is he gay?	I don't know.  I don't think so.
But somebody wrote those songs.	So, what's your point?
So, what's your point?	Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.	No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?	No.  He smokes.
No.  He smokes.	How about the other one?  His friend.
How about the other one?  His friend.	Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.	How about that guy at the bank?
I don't believe in statistics.	You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...	But I do want to.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.	I thank you.
And you didn't tell her?	She didn't give me a chance.
I came after the woman I love.	He missed me.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?	What?  You know him?
You used to love it when I called you doll.	You said it differently then.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?	Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.	That's really romantic.
I have to talk to her.	She's not here.

Is this slow enough for you?	Charlie, how are you?
Rejected, worthless, miserable.	Yeah. Like that.
You drive like a maniac!	I call this the staccato.

It was Beth's idea.	I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.

Ssh. He's great.	Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
I can't do that.	Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.

Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.	Evelyn, put her to bed.
Young lady, you're drunk!	Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.	Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Jack, I was just trying to help.	We'll make it, we'll be fine.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.	Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.

Come on, Richard, I'm serious.	You're giving me the creeps.
You're giving me the creeps.	Am I dead or not?
Am I dead or not?	There's one way to find out.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?	Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.	I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.	It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.	It really wasn't that difficult.
Dancing with you.	You're a sweet man, Richard.
You're a sweet man, Richard.	I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.	Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?	I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.	You look exactly the same.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.	How'd you know that?
That's Renee alright.	I suppose so.

Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.	He was dead. You know he was.
Is this a good spot?	I'm not burying him here...
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.	He pissed me off.
I know, Mom.	You know everything, don't you?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?	Right here, Mom...
I don't know what to do, Bob.	You'll never find it in the dark.
Are we interrupting, Andy?	In a word, Bob...
In a word, Bob...	Charles is right behind me.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.	Really? Who thinks that, sir?
This time. What about next time?	There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?	That's not what I said.
That's not what I said.	You're scared. You think we're near the end.
Maybe you should think about it.	What's that mean?!
What's that mean?!	Maybe you should think about it.
Maybe you should think about it.	I'm not going to die.
What's wrong with you?	Close the law book.
Close the law book.	I'm not going to close the--
I'm not going to close the--	CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.	We're not skipping this treatment.
We're not skipping this treatment.	I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
You're going to the office?!	You're not smiling.
Why are you getting dressed?	You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
It could be parasites, an infection...	A reaction to AZT...
Aren't you giving an exam?	I said, don't worry about it.
Thanks, you guys.	Yeah. Thanks, guys.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.	I'm seeing him this afternoon.
I know that, Charles.	More than your friend. Family.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...	About my blood work?
Thanks for coming by.	You bet. We'll see you later.
Are you a good lawyer?	I'm an excellent lawyer.
I'm an excellent lawyer.	What makes you an excellent lawyer?
A regular all-American guy?	I suppose you could say that.
I suppose you could say that.	Except... you were gay?
Except... you were gay?	I still am.
No. I didn't.	Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
I'll look over the Q and A.	You're ready, don't worry.
I know a good probate lawyer.	Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Sure. It's fine.	No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...	I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
We're friends of Beckett's.	It's me, you dork.
There is no relevant precedent.	Arline decision. Supreme Court.
They didn't fire her?	No. They didn't fire her.
How did they find out?	One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
Find a lawyer?	I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?	Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.	What's her name?
I buy that.	As in, the vegetable?
Little baby girl.	Kids are great.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?	Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...	It's okay. Can I sit down?
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?	I have AIDS.
What can I do?	Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
Answer the question, please.	No. I can't really see it.
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?	I guess it was 1984, 85.
Something like that.	Do you take risks?
Do you take risks?	In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
Were you recently promoted?	Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
What did you say?	I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.	Thank you. No more questions.
Ms. Burton. You're black.	Is that a question?
Is that a question?	No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.	Uh.... No. Not really.
We're going to draw blood.	Why are we going to do that?
Why are we going to do that?	Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.	You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?	It satisfied me.
Were you pleased with his work?	We were satisfied.
What kind of people?	People who want to bend the rules...
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...	But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...	... we've got a committee meeting.
You're the asshole, buddy.	Get a life.
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?	My lettuce is wilting.
How many gays do you know?	How many do you know?
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?	Why should I?
You taught him a lesson.	Yes, we did.
Yes, we did.	Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
Yeah. But we took care of him.	How did you do that?
Going on... like...?	Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.	Any women on board?
Attorney for the plaintiff?	Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.	On behalf of the defendants?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.	Andy, you don't want this.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...	... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...	... But we shouldn't have fired him...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...	... It's time to get this society back on track!
What? What is it?	It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?	Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Tell me that was you.	Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?	Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.	Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
Bring the light!	What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --	Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
You'd die for them?	I would try for them.
I would try for them.	You barely know them.
Step aboard, Carolyn.	I can't....I can't....
I can't....I can't....	Here. Make it easy on you.
Here. Make it easy on you.	Don't do this to me....
Don't do this to me....	Just give me your hand.
Just give me your hand.	But they...they could still be....
They're already dead. Get on board.	You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
Just come with me!	Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.	What, you're afraid?
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!	We can't make it.
As fast as you can.	You sure you can keep --
You sure you can keep --	As fast as you can.
How many you see?	One or two.
Back to the ship, huh?	Get out of our way.
What do you see? Riddick?	Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
We can, can't we? Trust you?	Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Had it with deals.	But I just wanted to say --
But I just wanted to say --	Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.	An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?	Entered our minds.
Entered our minds.	I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
You did this? To yourself?	"Slam doctor. Well, we called him ""doctor."""
"Slam doctor. Well, we called him ""doctor."""	Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.	Can we switch?
Can we switch?	What, switch what?
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.	How many bottles?
How many bottles?	Not sure. Ten?
Like the light is scalding it.	It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
Christ, you don't know what's out there!	I know what's in here!
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.	Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
We cannot go through there....	How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
We aren't completely stupid.	Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
How much you weigh, Johns?	What the hell's it matter?
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.	Smoke screen for what?
Smoke screen for what?	For your own fear.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!	'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
I never said I was.	Never said you were a hype, either.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --	<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --	So what happened? Where are they, then?
Well, don't ask me to.	Thought you didn't believe his story.
He used that?	Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.	So why isn't it all bloody?
So why isn't it all bloody?	I assume he licked it clean.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.	Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --	You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Better keep moving....	What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.	Which means he went toward sunrise.
Amazing. I'm Johns.	Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Well? Is it just the pump?	Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....	"You mean that ""load"" of passengers?"
The sled as a shield....	And what about the cells?
I would rather we all stay--	Do what I say. Please.
You know who Muhammad was?	Some prophet guy?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.	Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
What're you doin'?	Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?	Has anyone checked the coring room?
We crossed our own tracks.	He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.	Please...this solves nothing...please....
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....	The child heard you before any of us could even....
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.	Oh, so I'm disposable?
Very big beads.	Not staying in here another....
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.	Like an emergency life-raft, right?
What the hell are these?	Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
A toast to whatever he just said.	I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
...then we saw this.	Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
What's her name, anyway?	What do you care?
"Kept calling it ""murder"" when I did it."	Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
So which one caught your eye?	Don' look, don' look, don' look....
Not if I'm the one.	What if you're one of five?
Ain't all of us gonna make it.	Just realized that, huh?
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.	No. She's not.
"<u>Fuck me</u>. You said ""clear."""	"Said ""looks clear."""
"Said ""looks clear."""	Well, what's it look like now?
Think about that reward, Johns.	I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.	How 'bout a cut in your gut?
I'd rather piss glass.	Well, you got the big gauge.
Well, you got the big gauge.	Wanna rag your fat mouth?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?	Not afraid of the dark, are you?
So much for your nightfall.	So much for my cocktail hour.
What, it's broken?	Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Seal the cave?	That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Dr. Zaius --	Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?	Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.	You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?	Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
What are you doing there?	Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.	Do you have any weapons?
Do you have any weapons?	The best. But we won't need them.
The best. But we won't need them.	Just the same, I want one.
How did it go?	There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
Well, maybe they're not.	No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.	Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -	It's probably wrong --
The evidence was very meager --	You didn't think so then.
'Then how do you account for me?,	I don't. And I'm not going to try.
Now, just a minute --	Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.	Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?	Where did you learn to do this?
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.	What's so special about him?
What's so special about him?	Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.	Blessed are the vegetarians.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.	Let's find them all.
Any particular reason?	None at all.
But how long is a day?	Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
Will he live?	I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.	Do as I say.
He's trying to form words.	Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?	See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.	Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.	Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Air leak. Died in her sleep.	You don't seem very cut up about it.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.	By our time.  You've turned gray.
It's no use ... there she goes.	Forget it. Abandon ship.
I think you're making a mistake.	That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.	Relax. You'll see it all later.
Shouldn't we be moving on?	I'm for that.
She comes along too.	Zira doesn't want your female.
Zira doesn't want your female.	I want her.
I want her.	If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --	Fine. Just let her out.
Who put them up?	The Hunt Club.
The Hunt Club.	To scare off humans?
Gorilla hunters ...	Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
I told you not to bring the other one.	He wouldn't leave her.
He wouldn't leave her.	All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
What is that?	A man, Dr. Maximus.
One is in a museum!	Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...	Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.	My name is Taylor.
Thats a lie!	Mind your tongue, madame.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?	No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
Tell him to pull back!	Cease fire! Withdraw!
What is your proposal?	When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?	Twelve hundred years ago.
Stop right there.	Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.	You lied. Where is your tribe?
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?	With one of them.
With one of them.	Identify him, then. Speak to him.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.	All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.	Taylor, you can't.
Taylor, please --	Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?	She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
You! ... You knew about this?	No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.	You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!	There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?	Listen, listen -- I can speak --
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.	Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.	Do you believe him?
Do you believe him?	Like you, I find it difficult.
This is his assertion.	Where are they now?
He's moving his fingers!	Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.	But perhaps he understood --
I SHIT on all o' you.	KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.	He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!	Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.	YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.	How the hell did he get away?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.	Yeah, what is it?
So what's the problem?	Says he can't walk.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.	You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?	Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.	Fuck you bitch.
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...	I got one...
Where's Elias come from?	'Lias come naturally.
Where's he from?	Barnes comes from Hell.
Hey Taylor, you okay man?	Yeah. How 'bout you?
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!	Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
I'll go with you.	No... I move faster alone.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?	Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.	And you, do you believe?
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.	...don't feel like it either.
But what'd she actually do?	She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.	Feelin' good's good enough.
Okay - got light duty, three days.	Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.	What you got there - beers?
What we got here a crusader?	Sounds like it.
You volunteered for this shit man?	You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!	What are you talking about!
What are you talking about!	You know what I'm talking about!
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.	Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
Whew! - where that come from?	Found it. Growing in a garden.
Found it. Growing in a garden.	Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.	That's what he is... Baaaa!
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.	If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
You wanted to see me sir?	Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...	I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.	You don't want to hear about it?
I think you're drunk.	Just drunk enough.
I think I'd like to dance.	Why certainly, baby.
Don't I even get my face slapped?	Would you mind?
Would you mind?	Okay. You win.
The brush-off, huh?	I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
What's the matter?	I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.	We have some nice places around Vancouver.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.	I'm sure you have.
I haven't been invited.	Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.	Very nice Mitchell turns.
I don't know.	You don't know.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.	How far does this train go?
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.	My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
Good evening, Miss.	How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
Good morning. Can I do something for you?	I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
I think you mean that.	Do you think I was faking?
Do you think I was faking?	If I did-I don't-now.
If you're doing all this just for me.	That, and the fun of it.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.	There would be a moon tonight.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.	You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.	How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
No percentage in that.	They're going to arrest me.
They're going to arrest me.	I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.	I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
So have I.	From you, I like it.
You don't know who he is?	He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.	He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.	Anything I can do about it?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.	I didn't notice him.
I didn't notice him.	We walked right passed him. He's following us.
What time is it?	Quarter after one. Why?
Quarter after one. Why?	There's a lot of night left to live through.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.	Certainly not to me.
Certainly not to me.	Just who are you, anyway?
He could hardly help suspecting you.	That's putting it mildly.
You tried to run away.	There wasn't any plane.
There wasn't any plane.	It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.	I'd rather wait until it does matter.
Nice of him.	He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.	He was a great boy for that. What else?
He was a great boy for that. What else?	That's all there is.
I know it's a littler late for an apology.	Much too late.
Much too late.	Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
Do you think I don't?	Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.	You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
And do you amuse the guests?	No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?	You're drinking it.
Would it make you anymore amusing?	Whatever you say.
Whatever you say.	I didn't say anything.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.	What did you say his name was?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.	Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.	Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer?  Well, all right.	Beer or ale, Miss?
Beer or ale, Miss?	Ale. I don't mind.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.	I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
I know that.	But even if you were in love with me.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.	To do what?
To do what?	I can't answer that.
I can't answer that.	What will they do to you?
What will they do to you?	That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
Points very straight to her.	He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--	What does he see?
Time's up.  I'm off the case.	They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
This isn't a very good place to talk.	I don't want to talk.
I don't want to talk.	I've come here to arrest you for murder.
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.	If I understand what you meant by that.
If I understand what you meant by that.	You understand perfectly.
You understand perfectly.	Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?	There isn't anything you can do.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?	We try to be decent.
We wouldn't have met at all.	True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.	You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.	You've had dealings with the police before?
You've had dealings with the police before?	Who hasn't--one way or another?
You were there when I last saw him.	I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.	You must come from pretty far South.
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.	Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.	I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
Where's you get it?	A graduation present.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?	Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.	Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Please answer my question.	You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.	That's an evasion and you know it.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.	I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
I'll have to know a little more than that.	I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.	Morning. Any calls?
Morning. Any calls?	Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.	All right. Get him.
Bluff. You've waited too long.	For five hundred, what do I get?
For five hundred, what do I get?	I go home and paint the kitchen.
I go home and paint the kitchen.	For two hundred?
For two hundred?	I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.	You mentioned information.
Got it on you?	Got the information on you?
Got the information on you?	Get it in half an hour.
You asked for it.	I'm still asking. What do you want?
I'd like a few words with you, in private.	I'm not interested in blind dates.
And without much discrimination.	Leave that one lay.
Leave that one lay.	They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?	In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
All right, let's see the buzzer.	What's a buzzer?
What's a buzzer?	So you're not a cop.
So you're not a cop.	Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?	Who told you my name?
Who told you my name?	I've got good ears.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.	I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.	Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?	I never notice the view after the first week.
A couple of hours.	I have a warrant for her arrest.
I have a warrant for her arrest.	That must hurt.
Would that make me a heel?	You'd be breaking the law.
You'd be breaking the law.	Doesn't answer the question.
Doesn't answer the question.	The only answer I have for you.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.	It could have been an accident.
It could have been an accident.	That COULD BE TOLD.
That COULD BE TOLD.	Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Time for a little chat?	If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?	Thanks.  I don't mind.
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?	Hardly. Who's the girl?
How's life treating you?	The usual grind.
The usual grind.	Round of golf Saturday?
Round of golf Saturday?	If I can get off.
How would you know, Brandon?	Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?	You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.	Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?	Lay off, can't you?
A little something on account perhaps?	Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.	I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.	Convenient, isn't it?
What are you doing here?	I don't think you locked your door.
I don't think you locked your door.	What do you want?
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?	I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
What do I get for it?	You get it's brother.
You get it's brother.	Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.	Go live in a tent.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.	The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?	Well.  What about it?
Do I know who lives down there?	You can find out.
Pretty big chance, huh?	You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
Was that about the right angle?	I think so.
I think so.	Where's the shell?
Where's the shell?	Should be over there.
Not too hard, is it?	Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--	There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.	Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
I'll know when I find it.	I guess I'm just ballast around here.
So the shell ought to have gone over?	Unless the gun was slanted up.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.	I've met her.
You in charge here?	So it seems Sergeant.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.	Did you ever have a serious operation?
Did you ever have a serious operation?	Mortar shells are not funny, either.
Not if it clears the air.	It does.  May I go now?
It does.  May I go now?	I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--	I don't understand.
I don't understand.	Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.	Now, you're being beastly.
What about me?	Not quiet yet.
Scotch and plain water, I think.	Warm water, no doubt.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?	The card says so, doesn't it?
The card says so, doesn't it?	Brandon handled the money envelope.
No doubt about that one.	How about Magruder?
How about Magruder?	He checks too.
He checks too.	That leaves two strangers.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.	Mayfield?  She fit into this?
Get out of here!	What are my orders, sir?
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.	But you still think she's innocent.
I don't know, sir.	Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
I hear she's a very pretty girl.	Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.	Aye.  You have a point there.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.	Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.	I say YES!
What does it look like?	How long have you had it?
You already have the checks, darling.	I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
How about your new friend?	I told you she's just..
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.	That's not very kind.
I have a rough idea.	You'd go to jail. For a long term.
Who's the girl?	Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Why should I mind?	You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?	You ought to know why.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.	It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
You're kind to be so encouraging.	I think you'll do very well.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.	It's kind of you to see me.
Now first of all, tell us your name.	Penfield.  James Penfield.
I'm not sure I can face it.	Keep me company.
Congratulations.  Who with?	A glamorous young lady way above his station...
It's terribly good.	Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?	No.  I'd want to--
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.	No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--	I'll have some of that.
I'll have some of that.	...break away completely from--
...break away completely from--	And some of that.  Sorry.
We don't seem to get much time to talk.	I know.  I'm sorry.
Shall we have a drink or something?	Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
Jeremy phoned this morning	What did he want?
That'll be fun	In your car
I haven't really thought about it.	Well, you should.
I think she liked me.	Did she talk about me?
Did she talk about me?	No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.	You just might.
In radio we're different.	I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
Why not stay?	I have to be up early.
I thought it was tremendous.	I think it went on rather too long.
I think it went on rather too long.	I couldn't bear for it to end.
I couldn't bear for it to end.	And I didn't like that man.
And I didn't like that man.	Oh, but he was terrific.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.	You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Too bad.  What did your father do?	My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
Still in love?	I'm not sure.
That's enough of that.	We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.	Far too long.
Now, top secret file.	Come on.  Hand over.
To the Fleet.	To the Fleet.
To the Fleet.	And the Argies.
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.	No jokes.  James is in love.

To the airlift.	Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?	Not yet you know any of these people?
What about the Cromwells?	They don't count.
Why not sit down and wait?	Okay, I will.
Okay, I will.	She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.	Oh, I see.
Oh, I see.	Have you come to talk about me?
Have you come to talk about me?	Not at all.  History.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.	I'm not here.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.	I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
Yes, you said.	Now, are you going to have some more tea?
Now, are you going to have some more tea?	No, thanks Dad.
No, thanks Dad.	Or a beer.  I've got some in.
What would you call it?	I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.	Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
What have you got there?	You'd look naked without one.
You're so famous now.	And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
Ah, Susy, it...	Tom . .. bed!  Go on.

You never were...	I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Wild ride, huh?	Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!	Naw, you pull it!
You gotta tell me where she is.	And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
I'm not armed.	But you're not alone.
But you're not alone.	Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
Don't screw around man, pull it!	You do it... you first!
You do it... you first!	One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
You gonna pull?	After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Utah, you copy bruddah?	Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!	I'll take that as a yes.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?	I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?	You gotta earn trust.
You gotta earn trust.	Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
I gotta be fucking crazy.	Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?	No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Surf conditions okay?	A little mushy.
Angelo!  Don't fire!	Kid, get outta the way!!

The hell are they?!	They took a left at the next light!
Time for lunch.	Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
They're on their way to Maui.	No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
... so I started tailing him.	This Zen master surfer.
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?	Right here, partner.
Yeah.  What's your theory?	The fucking punks are surfers.
They don't go for the vault?	Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.	Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.	Punk.  Quarterback Punk.

Who's the girl?	Catch of the day.
Catch of the day.	Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.	People are expendable to Bodhi.
People are expendable to Bodhi.	Meaning you were expendable.
What do you want?	Shrimp and fries.
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?	Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.	My name's Johnny Utah!
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?	Something... in the trees...
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.	I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
I'll see you there.	Right behind you.
What the hell do you think you're doing?	We're going to need everyone.
You're wastin' your time.	No more games.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.	Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?	No way, old buddy.
No way, old buddy.	You never did know when to quit.
You saw what?	I saw it.
What's that, General?	Someone else will be going in with you.
You're looking well, Dutch.	It's been a long time, General.
What in God's name...?	I think it's Hawkins.
I think it's Hawkins.	Where the hell is his body?
Where the hell is his body?	There's no sign of it.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.	There's something else, Major...
Your uncle will like this.	He's not really my uncle.
He's not really my uncle.	They never are, dear.
Please, we hardly know each other.	Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
What's that long building over there?	Storage, I think.
Storage, I think.	Not with those smokestacks it's not.
You've got a lot of nerve.	No.  What I have is a lot of money.
I got tired of hating my father.	It was good.
It was good.	It felt good.
What did you do to him?	What do you mean?
I've never treated you like a whore.	You just did.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.	Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.	I have to go to New York tomorrow.
I more than liked it.	I know.  I'm glad.
Edward, I can't.	Shush.  Of course you can.
Shush.  Of course you can.	What if I lose it?
What if someone tries to steal it?	I'll guard them and you with my life.
Do I look okay?	Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!	Vivian, what the --
Real genuine guy.	He's good at what he does.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.	I think it's exciting.

I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.	Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?	It was great.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.	Yeah... I know what you mean.
Was that you?	Who did you think?
Who did you think?	Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...	Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.	Yeah.  I just got it.
Kit!  Where've you been?	I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.	He's not gonna want us.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?	Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Carlos had some great rock.	I bet.  That was our rent!
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?	Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
Kit give me nothin'.	You bullshittin' me?
You bullshittin' me?	Of rent I do not bullshit.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?	I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.	Oooh, I love those.
Oooh, I love those.	I leave extras, miss.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.	Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.	Yeah, well, I check out today.
Yeah, well, I check out today.	You're not accompanying him to New York?
But I always eat like this.	Either you're European or badly brought up.
Either you're European or badly brought up.	Hmmm... I vonder vich.
What if they serve soup?	They will serve salad.
They will serve salad.	But what if they serve soup?
But what if they serve soup?	Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.	I like steak.
I like steak.	Then you would use your--
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.	Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?	I think you'll find it normal enough.
I think you'll find it normal enough.	Will I like it?
Will I like it?	You'll like it fine.
You'll like it fine.	Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
I got a dress.	I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
I'm just going to my room.	You're a guest here?
You're a guest here?	I'm -- I'm with a friend.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.	And who is that?
Do you remember me?	No, I'm sorry, I don't.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.	I was in here yesterday.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?	I don't think it would fit you.
Are you looking for something in particular?	Yes.  Something... conservative.
May I help you?	I'm just looking, thanks.
Having a good time, Vivian?	Yeah.  Thanks.
Yeah.  Thanks.	All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
Then I'm here till I die?	Till they kill you. Yeah.
Till they kill you. Yeah.	Then why bother curing me?
I killed him myself.	Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.	Should I be?
Should I be?	Brides often are, I'm told.
Brides often are, I'm told.	I do not marry tonight.
Every ship but the four you sent.	Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
... as ... you ... wish...	Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
Does it bother you to hear?	Nothing you can say will upset me.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.	With pride. What can I do for you?
With pride. What can I do for you?	You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.	Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?	He knows I do not love him.
He knows I do not love him.	"""Are not capable of love"" is what you mean."
"Did you say, ""I do""?"	Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?	What hideous sin have you committed lately?
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?	Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.	No. No. We have already succeeded.
Can you move at all?	Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
I will never doubt again.	There will never be a need.
I fear I'll never see you again.	Of course you will.
Of course you will.	But what if something happens to you?
But what if something happens to you?	Hear this now: I will come for you.
Hear this now: I will come for you.	But how can you be sure?
But how can you be sure?	This is true love. You think this happens every day?
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.	As you wish.
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.	I believe you -- So what happens now?
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.	What do I do?
What do I do?	Finish him, finish him. Your way.
I only dog paddle.	Veer left. Left. Left!
No more rhymes now, I mean it.	Anybody want a peanut?
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!	I'll be right back.
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.	Right, right, sorry.
Will this do?	Where did you get that?
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?	Over the Albino, I think.
Have you any money?	I have a little.
-- Fezzik, please --	Everybody ... MOVE!!
To find the Man in Black, obviously.	But you don't know where he is.
How many could you handle?	I don't think more than ten.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?	If there are, we'll all be dead.
Probably he means no harm.	He's really very short on charm.
He's really very short on charm.	Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.	Yes, some of the time.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.	I don't mind so much.
Westley's only faking, right?	You want me to read this or not?
You want me to read this or not?	Who gets Humperdinck?
Who gets Humperdinck?	I don't understand.
Someday, you may not mind so much.	Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --	I don't be-leeve this.
-- wait, just wait --	-- well, when does it get good?
Yeah. It's really good.	Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
I brought you a special present.	What is it?
What is it?	Open it up.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.	The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
It won't be easy, Sire.	Try ruling the world sometime.
No.  To the pain.	I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
I tell you once again -- surrender!	It will not happen!
And it is guarded by sixty men.	And our assets?
And our assets?	Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Your guess is as good as mine --	I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
-- all that I have and more please --	-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- offer me everything I ask for --	-- anything you want --
-- anything you want --	I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
-- yes --	-- power too -- promise me that --
He's already dead.	He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
Who are you?!	No one of consequence.
No one of consequence.	I must know.
I must know.	Get used to disappointment.
Because I know something you don't know.	And what is that?
And what is that?	I am not left-handed.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.	Then why are you smiling?
You are wonderful!	Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --	Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.	You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.	You are ready, then?
We'll wait until you're ready.	Again. Thank you.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?	Nothing comes to mind.
I want to duel him left-handed.	You know what a hurry we're in.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-	You're sure nobody's following us?
Making sure nobody's following us.	That would be inconceivable.
Then make your choice.	I will. And I choose --
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.	Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Inhale this, but do not touch.	I smell nothing.
Have fun storming the castle.	Think it'll work?
Think it'll work?	It would take a miracle. Bye!
Yeah, an hour.	A good hour. Yeah.

Your grandfather's here.	Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?	You are sick, that's why he's here.
You are sick, that's why he's here.	He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

Let's all talk about Mary.	Who are you, friend?
Who are you, friend?	Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.  Where is she, Miss Crane?
Not even a hunch. Just hope.	With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
I don't know.	Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.	Okay. If you'll come along...
Yes, Mr. Lowery.	Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
Did he say anything about my sister?	Just what he told your detective.
What difference does that...	Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.	With the forty thousand dollars?
Forty thousand dollars.	And the police haven't been able to...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!	Now. Your sister is missing how long?
It's regular. Okay?	I could stand something regular.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?	Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.	Of course we will.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.	Neither will I.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.	Does that mean we can't...
Without calling me?	In a hurry.
Just wait here?	Contemplate your... panic button.
Probably on his way back right now.	Sam, I'm going.
Sam, I'm going.	You'll never find it.
Sam! Why call when we can go?	And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.

Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?	Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.	Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.

To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?	No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
I was getting to that!	What do you know about it?
What do you know about it?	Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.

They thought she'd be coming to me.	Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?	Just before she died she came to--
Just before she died she came to--	Did she talk?
Gosh, you had me fooled.	Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.	Okay--I'll be here at eight.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.	Indeed, he has often told me.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh	Take him to the psychopathic hospital.

Who are you? What is your name?	I don't know, [I tell you].
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.	That's it. You get it quick.
That's it. You get it quick.	But where do the rats come in?
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?	Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
Do you have many patients, doctor?	Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
How do you do.	Well, news of Buckley?
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?	Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
What are you going to do?	I'm going to call the police.
I'm going to call the police.	No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
Dr. Meirschultz, please.	He isn't here.

Did you hear?	Yes, the child ...
I think so.	Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
But what about lunch?	I'll have it for supper.  So long.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.	I'd call it stupid at any time.
So that's the way it is?	That's the way I feel about it.
That's the way I feel about it.	I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.	What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.

What! What are you talking about?	The body of Joan Gale!
The body of Joan Gale!	Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Now don't that call for an extra!	I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.	Let it go.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?	I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Which one is me? The horse?	Get out of here.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.	Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.	You give me a pain!
And they never proved anything against him.	Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!	Nope, I'm through!
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?	Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?	I don't remember. Not so very far--
I don't remember. Not so very far--	Don't remember what day that was, do you?
Don't remember what day that was, do you?	No, sir. About three months ago.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?	It's all yours.

That's the one.	They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?	Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.	Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
He might get some publicity out of it.	No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
What is it? What happened?	Don't ask any questions. Come on!
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.	Oh, is that what caused it?
How much money have you got?	Heaven knows. A lot.
You go in for dangerous things.	Darned if I don't!
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --	Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...	That happens to be the truth.
That happens to be the truth.	Who'd steal her body?
Who'd steal her body?	That's what they're going to ask you.
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you.	Good night, sir.
Good night, sir.	Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
But I have some friends waiting.	That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.	I will only be gone about half an hour.
What are you laughing at?	He can't hear you.
She is the soul of that statue.	I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
Yep. Everything settled.	Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.	I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
I've been dreaming about this.	Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.	The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
What universe are you in, Paul?	A quantum one.
Why am I doing this?	It's an experiment.
A place you've never been.	That's the physicist's playground.
Could we go somewhere?	I'm heading out of town.
I've been dreaming about you.	Day or night?
What are you going to do, Rose?	Take a little walk with me, huh?
You won't die, Rose.	Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?	Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.	Am I hurting you?
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.	Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.	Buddy, you're just a child.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.	'Course it does.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.	Don't mention it.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?	Well, some fiend might.
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.	What did you expect?
What did you expect?	Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.	Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.	There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?	There was this old man that ate his niece.
But who were they?	They were just bad men, that's all.
They were just bad men, that's all.	In what sense were they bad?
In what sense were they bad?	Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.	Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
Of course not!	Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Yeah, I know.	Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.	I do, too!
I do, too!	All right, what do you know?
All right, what do you know?	Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
Neither do I.	Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.	I do, too.
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?	No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
Open that door, damn you!	Daddy, what's the matter?
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.	Yeah, he's still up there.
Yeah, he's still up there.	What's taking the rascal so long?
I don't know.	The girl strikes like a cobra.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?	No. Why should Rose be in my room?
You were up late last night, Brother.	Well, a little.
Well, a little.	Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
She's getting herself up to go out.	What'd you say, Brother?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!	What did you say, Brother?
What did you say, Brother?	I said ahhh-dam stuff.
I said ahhh-dam stuff.	No, you didn't say that, Brother.
Why is it taking so long?	Here comes Daddy.
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.	Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.	So am I.
No, Mother, he's lying...	Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
She's putting the titty back.	Buddy, that was my place.
What are they doing?	Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.	What are they doing, Doll?
What are they doing, Doll?	He kissed her.
He kissed her.	Is that all?
Is that all?	He had his hand on her titty.
He had his hand on her titty.	Let me look.  Aww-rr...
This is my place and you can't have it.	Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?	They're discussing it.
They're discussing it.	I can't see, let me see...
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.	She's watching the car again?
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.	I think Daddy suspects.
I think Daddy suspects.	No, he doesn't. Not really.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?	Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?	That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.	That's what she would say herself.
That's what she would say herself.	A wonderful woman, boy.
No, son, she is dead.	Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?	Hello, Daddy. How are you?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.	It's Yankee whisky to me.
I am ahead of you.	Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
I think we both know her.	Yes, we know her.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!	I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.	It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.	Boys? You say to me boys?
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?	No reason at all, darlin'.
No reason at all, darlin'.	Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Well, time will tell, won't it?	Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Well, she's back.	What time is it?
What time is it?	Quarter of twelve.
Quarter of twelve.	Is she all right?
Is she all right?	I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.	You're not having lunch?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.	Oh. Did you say something?
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.	Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.	How goes it, darlin'?
Yes, I am.	No, you're not.
No, you're not.	Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
I don't believe it.	It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!	Well. What kinda job is it?
Well. What kinda job is it?	Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.	You mean a farm?
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?	What's the use, there ain't none.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?	Well, it's Billy.
Well, it's Billy.	And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.	I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!	I'm not hungry.
Is this ill right?	It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?	Oh, anywhere downtown.
Oh, anywhere downtown.	You don't know where you're going?
You don't know where you're going?	Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
You were up late last night, too, Rose.	Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?	There are more on the other side.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.	Got yourself up?
Got yourself up?	Yeah. I'm goin' out.
Rose, what are you doing up?	Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.	Is anything wrong?
Don't make me... me... me... get up!	Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?	Yeah, I remember it.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.	I see. Outside it.
Took your time gettin' here.	She has other things to do, Dave.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.	How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!	Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...	It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?	Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
What's the matter with him?	I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.	Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.	I was offered that job as a waitress.
Rose, you don't have to.	I don't mind.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.	You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Never again, never again...	I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...	No more dentists, no more dentists...
No more dentists, no more dentists...	It'll get better now.
I don't want to go to the dentist.	Be quiet, Rose.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?	More history, Rose.
More history, Rose.	Are you going to get your degree soon?
Are you going to get your degree soon?	Well, I am working on my thesis.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.	You're not gonna see him again.
You're not gonna see him again.	What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...	Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.	You think it's that good?
You think it's that good?	I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Happy Independence Day.	Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
Gimmie a butt.	You don't smoke.
Where we going?	We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
They... they shot me.	They shot us all, kid.
They shot us all, kid.	What day is it?
What day is it?	Same day as before.  I think.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?	Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?	What about him?
Clench your teeth.	Wh... what... ?!
That's them trying to kill us.	Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!	I got him.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!	Stop blaming yourself.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?	I'm just saying...
I'm just saying...	You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.	Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.	I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
I can work this.	No you can't.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.	What do you want me to do about it?
That wasn't my fault.	Save it.  Just go.
You shouldn't litter.	Thank you, concerned citizen.
Thank you, concerned citizen.	Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
How's your precious little school-marm today?	She's fine, as if you cared.
Lay off once, would you?	What'd I say?
He tried to kill us.	We've got the tape to prove it.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.	There probably is.
You could start over again with cash like that.	Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?	I'm waiting till the time's right.
You live like a pig.	Can't you say something nice once?
I can't believe we're stealing.	We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.	No, we're stealing.
Where we going?	We have to find Kittle.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.	You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Smooth move, hot-shot.	What was I supposed to do?
That's him alright.	It's go time, Billy-B.
It doesn't say that.	No, but it should.
Birth control's important.	What... what kinda thing is that to say?
Why do I always have to sit in back?	It's just the way things are, kiddo.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.	Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.	It's not gonna happen.
There'll be other chances.	Not like this.  Are you even listening?
The gang's all here!	Keep 'em busy.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.	Know what I love about dynamite?
Why the beach?	So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.	Billy!  Billy!
Think Zimmermann's watching?	Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
No more counting the big money for someone else.	Beholden to none.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?	Seatbelts fastened, please.
Get his attention.	Your wish is my command.
Been waiting long?	Just got here.
Just got here.	How'd we do?
How'd we do?	A.D. is a C.P.A.
A.D. is a C.P.A.	Come again... ?
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!	Out here.  On your knees.
Let's get this thing done.	All for one...
That's not true.	I know it is, even if you don't.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!	You think this is so easy?
You think this is so easy?	Can't be worse than you.
I'm gonna get beside him.	No you're not.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...	You know what I mean.
You know... you could say thank you.	You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
You always did have style.	It's one of a kind.
It's one of a kind.	So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.	You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.	All right. Stand by.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.	Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
Yoda spoke of another.	The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.	But I have no sister.
I can't do it, Ben.	You cannot escape your destiny.
You cannot escape your destiny.	I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.	Yoda will always be with you.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.	I can't see.
I can't see.	Your eyesight will return in time.
Your eyesight will return in time.	Where am I?
As you wish.	Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
I thought she was with you.	We got separated.
I don't know.  Fly casual.	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
You got her warmed?	Yeah, she's comin' up.
Are you all right?	Fine. Together again, huh?
Fine. Together again, huh?	Wouldn't miss it.
Wouldn't miss it.	How are we doing?
How are we doing?	The same as always.
The same as always.	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.	He wasn't. I can feel it.
He wasn't. I can feel it.	You love him, don't you?
The code's changed. We need Artoo!	Here's the terminal.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.	Charges!  Come on, come on!
What's going on?	I don't know.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.	No, wait! I thought you were blind!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!	It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.	All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Come on! Come on!	Oh, Artoo, hurry!
Here we go again.	All right, hang on.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.	I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.	Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
I'm going in.	Here goes nothing.
Good shot, Red Two.	Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
All wings report in.	Red Leader standing by.
Yes. It's you Leia.	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.	Then you know why I have to face him.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.	But, why must you confront him?
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?	Vader is here...now, on this moon.
What do you remember?	Just...images, really. Feelings.
Over there! Two more of them!	I see them. Wait, Leia!
You cannot hide forever, Luke.	I will not fight you.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.	I will not fight you, father.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.	If that is your destiny.
Come with me.	Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
The Emperor has been expecting you.	I know, father.
I know, father.	So, you have accepted the truth.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Yoda, I must know.	Your father he is.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...	Yes or no will do.
Yes or no will do.	Oh. Well, yes.
Oh. Well, yes.	How many languages do you speak?
It's as if we were glued to the spot.	You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
He might be.  I don't know.	Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
You promise you won't tell?	On my mother's grave.
Why you - what have you done with Janet?	Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
No, don't do that.	Oh don't be so shy.
Brad, please lets get out of here.	For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.	But it seems so unhealthy here.

Well I want to leave.	We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.	Then ask the butler - or someone.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.	I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
I'm coming with you.	There's no point both of us getting wet.
What was that bang?	We must have a blow-out.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.	You know this earth - this person.

I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.	Let's get outta this stink.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.	Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Don't get mental, man.	Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.	Ya always in a bad mood --
Ya always in a bad mood --	...Adrian ain't sharp.
I'll tear his head off.	Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?

Feel? I dunno... Happy.	How will you fight Apollo Creed?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?	Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Well, I'll be...	So what's your next move, Valiant?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.	You serve martinis, doncha?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?	That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.	Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?	Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.	Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
What's this, Roger?	A tweeting bird?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?	What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?	Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
What's that comin' from the bar?	Sounds like singin'.
What was <u>that</u>?	<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.	What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
Do you think the rabbit did it?	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?	Bastards put him on notice.
Is this paper even good?	Check the scrawl.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?	Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.	I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Does it hurt?	Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.	Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.	Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?	Toon cops worked me over.
Toon cops worked me over.	Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.	What am I, Earl?
Hold on a second.	Eddie, come on.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?	Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?	I didn't know who I could trust.
Where is he?	He's right here in the...
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?	Toons aren't given imperfections.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.	Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
You got the will in there, don't ya?	No, I don't.
No, I don't.	You tricked me, damn you!
You tricked me, damn you!	Take it easy.
Valiant!  You surprised me.	That was the idea.
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?	Have you got the will?
Have you got the will?	Maybe.  Why?
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
When will I hear from you?	As soon as is humanly possible.
I got him on loan from Disney.	Aren't you the lucky one...
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.	A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.	So's the job.
One too many safes dropped on his head?	Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?	Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?	From this box here...
No, kid, you're a real hero.	I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.	I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
I'll get it.	Get away from there.
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?	We can't do anything till it's dark.
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?	My brother.  Get inside.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.	But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...	Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.	Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Does this help?	Yeah, that's better.
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?	Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.	Don't ever forget that.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...	You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.	Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	I do bite my thumb, sir!
I do bite my thumb, sir!	Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.	Then I'll leave thee.
Then I'll leave thee.	Tempt not a desperate man!
By my head here come the Capulets.	By my heel, I care not.
A challenge, on my life.	Romeo will answer it?
Romeo will answer it?	Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.	Art thou hurt?
Every man betake him to his legs.	But 'tis no wit to go.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.	I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.	A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.	A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.	Teach me how I should forget to think.
Is the day so young?	But new struck cuz.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
No, cuz, I rather weep.	Good heart, at what?
Good heart, at what?	At thy good heart's oppression.
At thy good heart's oppression.	Farewell, my cuz.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?	Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.	Young Romeo is it?
I'll not endure him.	He shall be endured
He shall be endured	Uncle, 'tis a shame.
My poverty, but not my will consents.	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.	God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.	For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.	Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Good marrow, father!	Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
Where is my Lady's lord?	Romeo, come forth.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.	Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Speakest thou from thy heart?	And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?	Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!	Madam, I am here. What is your will?
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
So thrive my soul--	A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?	By the hour of nine.
By the hour of nine.	I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?	Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!	Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
I thought all for the best.	A Plague o' both your houses.
I will follow you.	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
Meaning, to court'sy.	Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.	A most courteous exposition.
A most courteous exposition.	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.	Pink for flower.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.	Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Why, may one ask?	I dream'd a dream to-night.
I dream'd a dream to-night.	And so did I.
And so did I.	Well, what was yours?
Well, what was yours?	That dreamers often lie.
That dreamers often lie.	In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.	Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?	Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
This is important.	Do you really think so?
Do you really think so?	You know it is.
Well I don't!	And I don't believe you...
We kept it...	Is that right?
Best beer in the world known to man or God.	Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...	That's why you were riding with him.
Who the fuck are you?	The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
Do I need to repeat myself?	No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.	And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
It's been known to happen.	Not to me, you know that.
Not to me, you know that.	I thought I did.
Are you alright?	Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?	I'm a patriate.
I'm a patriate.	Don't even think that I'm buying that.
I didn't say I was.	Bloody fucking hell...
I still am.	Is that right?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.	You were a soldier, were you?
Where's the case?	There's a problem...
Alright, Gregor, I'm...	Ready when you are...
You sure about this?	I'd stake my reputation.
I'd stake my reputation.	But would you stake your life, that's the question...
We'll double your price.	Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Really?  Do you have the money with you?	Do you have the material?
Do you have the material?	You first, Edvard.
You first, Edvard.	Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...	I think not.  After you...
Do you have it?	Not so fast.  Who's that?
We'll die if we stay here!	You'll die if you leave here.
And more importantly --	I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.	I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
But you hate each other!	What's a little hate between business partners?
It is, I'm telling you it is!!	You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
Then where is it?	I sent it to myself in Paris.
I sent it to myself in Paris.	Sent it where?
Sent it where?	A post office box.
Gregor, is that you?	Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.	It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
What are you doing?	Don't cross me...
Don't cross me...	Nobody's going to do that!
Then I guess we're set.	There is one other thing...
He's tough, your American friend.	Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.	And you respect him.
And you respect him.	Of course.  Don't you?
So this is what, a test?	Call it a reckoning of character.
He sees this differently, as you well know.	I didn't expect that he would.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.	You should really let a doctor look at that.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?	Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.	Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.	My way is better.
You shoot alright.	Gets the job done.
Gets the job done.	All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.	Not for long.
Not for long.	Long enough to shoot back.
Long enough to shoot back.	Is that right?
Is that right?	It's been known to happen.
It's been known to happen.	Why don't you go do better, then...
Where is this broad?	You should learn a little patience.
You should learn a little patience.	Is that right?
Is that right?	It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.	Not in mine.
I ride with fat-boy...	Eat shit and die slowly...
You should watch what you eat.	Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.	What a surprise...
What a surprise...	I got a surprise for you, blondie...
You better get some sleep, alright?	Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
What happened to it?	Gone.  Destroyed.
Gone.  Destroyed.	I guess that's for the best.
You speak French.	What of it?
Let's get him out of here...	Finish the job...
You have to stop doing that!	I'll work on it...
Time to quit.	Just like that?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.	Would you stop with that...
That's a good question.	Do you have a good answer?
Do you have a good answer?	No, I don't.
Do we need anything else?	Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
So I do it.	No you don't, and you know it.
No you don't, and you know it.	If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?	In a minute.
In a minute.	I think not.
I'm not here very much.	Business keeps you on the road?
Business keeps you on the road?	Something like that.
What the fuck happened?	I don't know...
I never made that claim.	I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.	You were behind the door?
How could you have done that?	Because I owe you.  Look at that...
It's my job.	Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
You sure your friend got the right place?	If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
You know him?	I know of him.
Alright, it's done.	You see the bullet?
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.	You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do this.	Yes I do.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?	No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.	But you can't.
It was at that.	A lot of people died.
A lot of people died.	I've seen a lot of people die before.
I borrowed that, too...	Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.	You were smoking?
The question still remains: what do we do now?	Gregor's cell phone...
I needed to know.	You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
What's going on?	I just wanted to see something.
Like Larry or Swede.	Exactly.  Why not bring them?
So is the woman.	Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.	I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I wanted to see who you were.	Who am I?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?	I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
Same thing, isn't it?	Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.	What's the difference?
What's the difference?	One's a lot more painful than the other.
What'd you say to him?	I asked if we could give him anything else.
He says this is their block.	As in, they own it?
As in, they own it?	Something like that...
I didn't know that you spoke French.	I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Pretty much what you'd expect.	That's what I thought.
To see a man about a thing.	I can do that.
He trusts you to lock up?	Let's just say he knows who I am.
Perhaps the police?	I know cops -- and you're no cop.
Sorry I'm late...	What makes you think we're here to meet you?
What makes you think we're here to meet you?	Who else would you be?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.	It's the Irish tape we want.
It's the Irish tape we want.	Gonna be tough.
You put everything on the line because you...	You slept with the fucker!!
Why didn't you kill her?	Why didn't you kill him?
Can you get it?	The Russian would be easier.
Do you have the tape?	I might know where you could get a copy.
My man, how you doing?	I'm alright.  And you?
I'm alright.  And you?	Doing well.  This is?
I don't know what you're -	Don't lie to me!!!!
It's too late...	It's NOT too late!
He killed her...he killed her...	What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?	He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...	Booth, listen to me...Booth!
Booth, listen to me...Booth!	He killed her...
Then we're screwed.	No we're not.
Maybe we should say somethin'.	Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --	Do you have everything?
Do you have everything?	I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...	We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!	You don't know if he was really gonna --
You killed him...	It's gonna be o.k.
It's gonna be o.k.	Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
Here it is.	There it is...now what about the others?
How long is it going to take?!	I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
Not bad enough to kill him.	Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
You're out of your mind.	Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
He's going to be trouble.	He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
He would have done it to us, right?	Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
I can't do that.	Okay then.  I'll do it.
What are you thinking?	I don't know...
It's the right thing to do.	It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.	We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.	No we didn't.  He died on his own.
I don't know...	This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
I...I can't do that.	Okay then.  I'll do it.
Okay then.  I'll do it.	That's not what I mean.
Well someone's gonna find them.	Hell, it won't be us!
Call it in I guess.  Why?	Why?  Are you kidding me?
What are we going to do?	What do you mean what are we going to do?
What do you mean what are we going to do?	I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Ten thousand right here.	There must be over a million dollars in here.
There must be over a million dollars in here.	Shit, more than that.
What the hell...	They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
Cash and what?	Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...	Never heard of it.
Never heard of it.	Oh, you would have done great.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?	The horniest dog in Nevada.
Ready to roll, partner?	Sure thing, and --
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!	Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
What are you proposing?	I want my share. All of it.
Why don't you get to the point.	My point, well...
Could it have been in the Mercedes?	Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
No.  Why?	Because someone may have gotten away.
Sally, do you love me?	You know I do.
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.	I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.	I swear to you, it's true...
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?	Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...	Yeah, it is...
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.	Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
A satellite dish?	Well I was just throwing out ideas...
So do I.	I love you Sally.
I love you Sally.	I love you.
How the hell did he find it?	He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
You're worth every last penny.	Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
He's not, he's...	That son of a bitch.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?	You deserve it is the occasion.
Are you sure you're OK?	Yeah I'm fine.
OK.  I love you.	I love you too.

A week ago, at most.	Thanks for your time.
Yeah, I've seen him.	What did he buy?
And what's that?	How about you give us what you have and leave.
I don't know.	This just might be our ticket!
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.	Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.	Did you say After Midnight?
Maybe.  Maybe not.	What are you getting at?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.	Excellent. I'll go down with you.

Oh Jesus Christ...	So I want the money and I want it now.
So I want the money and I want it now.	Well you can't have it.

Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.	Oh yes, she's very nice.
You get massage from Chinese girl before?	No.  It's my first time.
No.  It's my first time.	You pick any girl for you and your friend.
I could use a little vacation.	Amen to that, brother.
The Plaza Hotel?	A little Mu-shu.

About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.	No, Carter.  I can't take this.

How'd what go?	With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
I could get promoted right out of here.	What's wrong with that?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!	That's what you were supposed to be!

Any demands yet?	At this point we don't have much.
At this point we don't have much.	How much they want?

Make me an offer.	I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?	No, I'm good.
No, I'm good.	I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Crank or glass?	The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
Please ... don't do this ...	Answer the fucking question!
Murder.  Beautiful.	Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.	We got the 411 on your good old boy.
What? Is it bad?	I'm afraid so, Danny.
I'm afraid so, Danny.	Who is it?
That's because he doesn't have one.	Whata you mean?  He told me -
Bullshit. He's a liar.	News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.	You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
You've got no choice.	Whata you mean I've got no choice?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.	After that ass-whipping you gave me?
What the hell are you doing here?	Question is, what are you doing here?
Question is, what are you doing here?	I was trying to score some dope.
I was trying to score some dope.	Cut the shit, Flynne.
I was getting to it.	Tell me what?
Thanks for not judging me.	It's not my place.
It's not my place.	Don't you wonder why I do it?
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.	Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Danny, I'm touched.	Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.	Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
You got a name?	Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.	No last name?
I've got a hot one.	You go, boy.
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?	Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
You're lucky, Flynne.	Funny, I don't feel lucky.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.	Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?	They have. But they never found a lab.
What's that smell?	That would be me.
That would be me.	What'd you do, piss your pants?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.	Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Who the hell is Jimmy?	He's the only one I told.
We know what's going on.	I still don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah.  What about him?	Turns out he's connected.
The Mexicali Boys	And what does this have to do with me?
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.	Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
My sentiments exactly.	Why are you doing this?
Just no pleasing you, is there?	Just admit you're wrong.
You think that's a good idea?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Look at that place. It's creepy.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?	Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?	You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom, let's spend the night here.	There's no motels around here.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.	And you've got wiener breath.
Again, I thank you.	I was talking about Miles.
We're in business.	Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.	Don't we always take good care of you?
You thinking what I'm thinking?	Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.	I thought you were done.
What is that? Rum and coke?	Don't worry about it.
What is it, drugs?	Better than drugs.
Good luck, John.	Thank you, sir.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.	It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Find a chaplain.	...alright, let me know when.
That must be four thousand yards.	Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.	You take account of the wind?
You must be a hell a shot.	Not where I come from.
So, where are you from?	You writin' a book or somethin'?
You writin' a book or somethin'?	As a matter of fact, I am.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.	Like hell, you did.
He ain't Wade.	Nope, he ain't Wade.
What do you think?	I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.	I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
Y'all come back.	Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
So, that's Ryan.	Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.	The hell he didn't.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?	It's worth it.
It's worth it.	To each, his own.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?	Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
In the shadow by those two trees.	My guess, too.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.	I'd love to hear it.
Captain, what about our deal?	I changed my mind.
What'd you say, Captain?	I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.	Goddamn it, sir...
Would they notice and eighty-eight?	Sure, you got one?
Sure, you got one?	The Germans do.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.	Those guns are close.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.	You don't count.
I wonder where they're going.	Same place we are.
Good luck, Captain.	Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.	The men said, nine.
What is it?	A machine gun.
It looks like a Renoir.	Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?	I've been humming it.
It seemed appropriate.	You know classical music?
I wasn't made for this.	You think the rest of us were?
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...	It was nothing.
It was nothing.	But you could have gotten killed and I...
But you could have gotten killed and I...	Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.	You're welcome, John.
I think you're right, Keith.	You want me to take over?
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?	How about I go right, sir?
How about I go right, sir?	How about you take your position?
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?	It doesn't take this.
Three for three.	If we stayed, we could make a difference.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.	You're kidding yourself.
You're kidding yourself.	You never know.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.	Since when have things been normal?
Since when have things been normal?	You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Hell of a mission.	Yep, hell of a mission.
You get a translator, Captain?	I've got a line on one.
Worked, didn't it?	You tryin' to get yourself killed?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?	Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Here they come.	FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.	FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...	Get back to your positions!
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.	HERE THEY COME!
HERE THEY COME!	OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.	Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
Up.  We're moving out.	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.	We can't leave it here.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!	Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
There's always a bright side.	I'm listening, sir.
I'm listening, sir.	Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?	Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?	Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.	Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
Damn fool.  Sir.	Captain, he's fast!
I usually like surprises.	What are we likely to run into?
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.	Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.	He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
You think he really believed it?	Who knows?  It worked.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.	How can you, how can you say that?
How can you, how can you say that?	Because he's guilty.
Because he's guilty.	No, no he's not.
Understanding the following rights...	Speak with my lawyer.
Speak with my lawyer.	So you refuse to answer my questions?
This evening is over.	And your former wife.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.	Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.	For going to school?
For going to school?	Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.	Good for her.
Good for her.	I'll take the whole set.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?	I'll be home soon.
No, no, don't go in there.	Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
I'll be in my office.	I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
You're tough, J-man.	He's a mess!
I hope you understand.	Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.	I already did.
Did you sleep with her?	I admit nothing.
See you tomorrow.	See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
Look at those eyes.	Lloyd, give it up.
That's just so embarrassing.	Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Then what's love?	I'm gonna call her.
That's not even a scam.	What's a scam?
What's a scam?	Going out as friends.
Lloyd, it's us.	Look at his face, he did the deed.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.	Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
I don't feel anything.	Come on, it's graduation.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.	What is wrong with this girl?
I just saw Joe.  He's here.	Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?	One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.	I can accept that.
He'd like to start serving immediately.	I can put that together.
I can put that together.	Confirm this with my office and my client.
Confirm this with my office and my client.	I'll put this past my boss
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?	'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.	I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.	Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Swear to god.	I swear to god.
I swear to god.	But I found the money.
But I found the money.	Honey, it's not what you think.
Honey, it's not what you think.	What am I supposed to think?
What am I supposed to think?	Honey, about what?
No, but you stole from them.	I made their lives better.
I'm so ashamed dad.	Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
Dad, are you okay in there?	Just finishing up in here.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.	Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Do you love him?	I like him a lot.
Dad, I'm sorry.	You should be.
You should be.	I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Which they did.  Let me finish.	Okay, I give up.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.	Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
I just had a phone call.	Tell me, is it bad news?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?	Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I love you dad.	I love you too honey.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!	You like it?
One more time would be nice.	I love you.  Please, I love you.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?	I think that we should stop going out on dates.
No, I don't, I don't.	Yeah you do.
You shared it with a dick.	No I didn't.
No I didn't.	Is this because of your dad?
Did you talk to Corey?	Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.	Did you tell anybody?
Did you tell anybody?	Just my dad.
Just my dad.	You told your dad?
You told your dad?	You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.	Then don't do it.
Well, I need to study, and...	You need to study?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.	Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?	It was wonderful.
No, we don't have to say it.	How do you know what I'm going to say?
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?	How can I look at you and say this?
Are you comfortable?	Yes.  Are you shaking?
I don't think I am.	Then why are you shaking?
Then why are you shaking?	I don't know.  I'm happy.
Okay, this is important...	Am I wrecking my car?

Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.	The killer called her.
The killer called her.	What?  When?
Is that a threat, Detective?	When it's a threat, you'll know it.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.	Is that a threat?
What does this have to do with Sid?	Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.	He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.	Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.	DEWEY! IT'S GALE!

Neither are you, Magnum P.I.	Gale, your engine's still running.
Jennifer needs me.	Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?	I'm on duty.
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!	It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.	You used to say that was our strength.
I'm sorry, this is too good!	What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?	Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it?
What's your point?	No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.	It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.	Need to get in that building?
What the hell are you doing?	Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?	I am Gale Weathers!
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!	No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?	What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!	Just because you knew her?
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.	Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.	Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Gale he's got Dewey!	I know! He killed Kincaid!
Page 22, Candy's big moment.	Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
But you know my favorite name?	I'm hanging up right now.
Roman that's not the line.	It is in my script.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.	What?  What movie?
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.	Who is this?
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?	W-what do you want?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.	Are you sure?
No I need to call you. Just you.	I'm sorry, your voice.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!	I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.	Where the fuck did she go?
She can't get both of us.	Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
I thought she was dead.	She looked dead. Still does.
It's on the table.	No, it's not.
Dude. What are you doing here?	I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
You ready to party hard tonight?	You know it.
How'd you do?	Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.	Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.	So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?	Duh... that's quick.
Duh... that's quick.	I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
I didn't kill anybody.	No one's saying you did.
What? She asked.	It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?	No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.	You rode your bike out there?
NO! Don't believe him.	It's okay. Give me the gun.
I thought you were...	I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
I called my dad.	No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.	Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
You heard me.	Are you serious?
Are you serious?	Yeah... I think so.
Sshh... it's okay.	Or even a good porno.
I wanna let go. I do...	Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.	It's okay. We need to talk.
You know that's not true.	Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
It's been a year since she died.	Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Oh Billy... Please... God...	I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...	He's here. He's trying to kill me...
You know what my dad will do to you?	I'm going... I'm going.
My dad's in the other room.	I'll only stay a sec.
Billy? What the...	I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.	What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?	You sleep in THAT?
...leave me alone... please...	Answer the question and I will.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.	No it's not. It was Jason.
But you're doing so well.	Please go away! Leave us alone!
Please go away! Leave us alone!	Then answer the question. Same category.
What's his name?	I can't think.
I don't know...	Come on, yes you do.
Please don't do this...	Come on. It'll be fun.
I'll even give you a warm up question.	Don't do this. I can't...
Don't do this. I can't...	Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
What kind of game?	Turn off the light.
Please don't hurt him.	That all depends on you.
That all depends on you.	Why are you doing this?
I'm getting scared.	I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...	I believe you...
I believe you...	So you better leave.
So you better leave.	His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
What do you want?	TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
I'm two seconds from calling the police.	They'd never make it in time.
Is this some kind of a joke?	More of a game, really.
I told you not to hang up on me.	What do you want?
Dial someone else, okay?	You getting scared?
I have to go now.	Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.	Nah, I don't think so...
Nah, I don't think so...	Don't hang up on me.
What did you say?	I want to now who I'm talking to.
I want to now who I'm talking to.	That's not what you said.
That's not what you said.	What do you think I said?
Why do you want to know my name?	Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.	So, you gotta boyfriend?
So, you gotta boyfriend?	Why? You wanna ask me out?
Why? You wanna ask me out?	Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
I don't know.	You have to have a favorite.
I only eat popcorn at the movies.	I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Just some scary movie.	Do you like scary movies?
Why don't you want to talk to me?	Who is this?
Who is this?	You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	What's that noise?
I want to talk to you for a second.	They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.	So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.	Wait, wait, don't hang up.
Who is this?	Who are you trying to reach?
Who are you trying to reach?	What number is this?
What number is this?	What number are you trying to reach?
What number are you trying to reach?	I don't know.
I don't know.	I think you have the wrong number.
I'll call for backup.	I'll get my camera.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.	I don't think you're so bad.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?	Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.	Can I bring Kenny?
Can I bring Kenny?	NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
Deputy... good evening.	What brings you out to these parts?
What brings you out to these parts?	You never know when or where a story will break.
Then what are you doing here?	Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.	Mind if I join you?
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.	Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
No, not yet.	He's not a suspect, is he?
He's not a suspect, is he?	We haven't ruled out that possibil...
And why is that? Has something happened?	You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.	I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?	Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?	Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
What is she doing here?	She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?	Hold up a sec...
Does mom know?	Yes, you doofus.
What are you doing here?	Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.	Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Any word on my Dad?	Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Did you reach my Dad?	You're sure it was the Hilton?
You're sure it was the Hilton?	At the airport.
At the airport.	He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?	I don't know. I guess.
I don't know. I guess.	We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?	Keeping my eye on Sidney.
You think he could still be in town?	He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?	She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?	Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.	She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
She staying with you?	We haven't located her Dad yet.
I was first to respond.	What were you doing out here?
What were you doing out here?	Drive by patrol.
Drive by patrol.	How is she?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.	Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...	He's her boyfriend.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.	How is everything?
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.	The phone's dead.
Where is she?	Call the police.
That fish smelled strong.	I told you to send it back.
What's the delay?	About thirty seconds.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.	Have you talked to Cotton?
Please. You owe me.	I owe you shit.
I'm not here to fight.	Just stay back.
Just stay back.	I want to talk to you.
I want to talk to you.	Kenny. Camera. Now.
I'll look for it.	I'll send you a copy.
How's the book?	It'll be out later this year.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?	Yes, that's right.
Why would she lie about it?	For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.	Who are you?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.	If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Why would you call me from my front porch?	That's the original part.
Are you alone in the house?	That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.	Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.	So who are you?
So where are you?	Your front porch.
What's your favorite scary movie?	Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.	And why is that?
Have a good trip.	Sleep tight, sweetie.
Are you okay?	Can you knock?
Can you knock?	I heard screaming.
I heard screaming.	No you didn't.
...out at the airport...	...so call if you need me.
Stu was with me last night.	Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.	Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?	Working, thank you.
Working, thank you.	I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.	You got it.
Stop. Right there.	Don't shoot. It's me.
Don't shoot. It's me.	Don't come any closer.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.	Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
What's Leatherface doing here?	He came to make up.
He came to make up.	There goes my chance with Sid.
There goes my chance with Sid.	Like you had one.
I thought everything was checked out.	I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
And what would be your motive?	It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
So what's his reason?	Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.	She's saving herself for you.
Jesus, this place is packed.	We had a run in the mass murder section.
We had a run in the mass murder section.	You coming tonight?
And are the police aware you dated the victim?	What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?	It would certainly improve your high school Q.
For about two seconds.	Before she dumped him for Steve.
You're crazy -- both of you.	"The official term is ""psychotic""."
"The official term is ""psychotic""."	You'll never get away with this.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.	Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?	It's all part of the game.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.	Yeah, okay... whatever.
Yeah, okay... whatever.	Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
Why are they doing this?	Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.	Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.	Come on, let's rock.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.	Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?	I don't know...
I don't know...	Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.	It was him, Tatum. I know it.
Shit, what is he doing here?	I bet he's pissed.
Come on, Sid.	Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
Take a message.	It's alright. I'll get it.
Do you really think Billy did it?	He was there, Tatum.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.	Just like old times, ain't it?
Just like old times, ain't it?	No, nothing's like it used to be.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.	Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.	It's past seven.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.	Tell your mom I said thanks.
Tell your mom I said thanks.	Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Or a man's mentality.	How do you gut someone?
What am I? The beer wench?	Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
With that set of lungs -- she should be.	Tits -- see.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?	For once, Stu, drop it.
I thought you dumped her for me.	I did. He's full of shit.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?	I don't know, they just did.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.	I read about it in the paper.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.	It's always been like this.
It's none of my business anymore.	I thought you might want to be filled in.
I thought you might want to be filled in.	I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Have you heard?	No, I haven't heard.
No, I haven't heard.	There was a second.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...	So what?  This victim...
So what?  This victim...	... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Where was the girl?	What?  What?
What?  What?	Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!	Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Turn around.  Hands on your head!	What the hell's going on?
What the hell's going on?	Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?	I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
Give me the gun.	Her pretty head.
What's so exciting?	It's not too far away now.
Here he comes.	What the fuck is going on?
Delusions of grandeur.	You should be thanking me.
You should be thanking me.	And, why is that?
Put your gun down!!	Don't do this... please...
Don't do this... please...	Put the gun down, Somerset!
Tell me it's not true.	I can't let you do this...
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!	What did you say?
Throw your gun down now!	What are you talking about?  What happened?
Kiss me on the lips.	Give me a break.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.	When do we get to question him?
You knew I'd say yes.	No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
You do your job...	Where's the victory?
We could use about fifty more men here.	I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
What are you talking about?	We had him.
You stupid son of a...	No point in arguing anymore...
Think about it...	What the fuck is wrong with you?
What the fuck is wrong with you?	Think about how we got here!
We need a warrant.	We have probable cause now.
Wait... just wait.	It was him.
It was him.	You can't go in there.
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?	That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.	This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.	We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
It's not what you think it is.	The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
How do you know all about this?	I don't.  Neither do you.
How much money do you have?	I don't know... like fifty.
And so what?	Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.	It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
We don't know for sure...	Yes we do.  Here...
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.	Who pays the rent on time.
Sorry about that... I just...	Oh, it's alright.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.	No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
It is Victor.	Call an ambulance.
Why would we?	Satisfy our curiosity?
Does this make it with you?	Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?	You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.	We'll tag along.
And you don't?	I wish I still thought like you.
I wish I still thought like you.	Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
There must be something.	We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
You're sure your men didn't move this?	Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.	Did you read them?
And, if it's a threat.	We put her in a safe house.
You go to movies at least?	I read.  Remember reading?
What about sports?	What about them?
It's too soon for him.	Can we talk about this in private?
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.	Whoa, whoa... what?!
You think it was poison?	Guessing at this point is useless.
It's a bucket of vomit.	Is there any blood in it?
Who said this was murder?	No one yet.
You just met me.	Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Anything... anything missing or different.	I don't see anything.
I don't see anything.	Are you absolutely certain?
Are you absolutely certain?	I can't do this now... please.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.	I... I don't understand.
You should look into private schools.	I don't know...
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.	I don't know why I asked you to come.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.	I'm sorry, I only...
It's a hard place.	I don't sleep very well.
How long have you lived here?	Too long.  What do you think so far?
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.	It surprises me.  It really does.
Did their son see it happen?	I don't know.
How should I know?	But Mose Harper said...
But Mose Harper said...	That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
Lucy's going on seventeen now...	An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
What you saw wasn't Lucy.	It was, I tell you!
Let's get along...	Why don't you finish the job?
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.	I ain't wearing no gun.
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...	Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Another one, eh?	This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!	Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.	How far's the river from here, Mose?
You got any more orders, Captain?	Just keep goin'...
What good does that do?	By what you preach...none!
He cometh forth like a...	Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!	...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
Got a warrant?	You fit a lot of descriptions.
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.	Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
You ain't goin'...	He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.

Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.	Ain't yours yet.
How'd you come by this?	You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.	That's what I said.
That's what I said.	You got it with you?
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?	I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?	That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
What's that got to do with us?	What's goin' on?
They'll be back...	We won't be here...Come on!
How? She's even forgot her own language!	Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Why didn't he make his move back there?	I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Well, you're a widower now...	What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
Ethan, quit it!	Nine...  Ten!

Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...	Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.	You've done a lot of growin'...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.	Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
Was your niece about their age?	Not far from it...
Not far from it...	Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
She's not a little girl any more.	You've seen her!...She's alive?
You've seen her!...She's alive?	I've seen her...and she's alive.
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.	I got your boy killed.

Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!	A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?	That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.

It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?	Do I look like it that much?
Do I look like it that much?	Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
Hello.  Can I help you?	Does this dog here belong to you?

Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.	Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
Two hours at prayer!	Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.	I am not so well-born.
When the Queen commands it.	But at the playhouse. Nurse?
And I love poetry above all.	Above Lord Wessex?
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?	I have lost my gift.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?	Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.

That's my line!	Oh, but it is mine too!
Oh, do not go	I must. I must

You would not leave me?	I must. Look-- how pale the window.
No, the morning rooster woke me.	It was the owl--come to bed
And that was only my first try.	Well perhaps better than my first.

I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.	You flatter, my lord.
But why me?	It was your eyes. No, your lips.
I have spoken with your father.	So my lord? I speak with him every day.
But what of Lord Wessex?	For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
If you love her, you must do what she asks.	And break her heart and mine?

It's an unusual trade.	Yes it is.

Of course not.	That's not very logical, Lester.
Who were you talking to?	Who do you think I was talking to?
Who do you think I was talking to?	My secretary saw you with that boy.

-- No. No really.	Well, what is it, honey?
It must be something.	Well, it's George.

But you have problems?	-- Yeah, honey...
Well, he is.	So what's your point?
So what's your point?	Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.

I'm terribly sorry.	-- never mind.

Good for you.	He's a hairdresser.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.	All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.	Well he's not exactly a friend.
Well he's not exactly a friend.	Is he an enemy?
Is he an enemy?	Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.	-- sort of a boyfriend?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.	Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.

You seem disappointed.	No... how long did you say?
Call me Les.	Where to, Les?
No of course not.	-- we're going to be here all night.
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.	Have they sat down?
Have they sat down?	Everybody but us.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?	What do you mean?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?	I guess so.
No.  I'm just a little tired.	Then why don't you go to sleep?
Then why don't you go to sleep?	I can't.  I have too much to do.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.	I am, Dad.  Dad?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?	Come here for a minute, first.
You mean they ate each other up?	They had to, in order to survive.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.	What was the Donner party?
No I ain't.	Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Maybe he showed me something.	Try to think what it was.
I don't know.	Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Why don't you want to talk about it?	I'm not supposed to.
I'm not supposed to.	Who says you ain't supposed to?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.	Is Tony the one that tells you things?
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?	French Fries and Ketchup.
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.	I won't, Mom.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?	Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.	I won't make any noise.
Do I have to?	Yes, I'd like you to.
Because he hides.	Where does he go?
Where does he go?	To my stomach.
To my stomach.	Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Talking to Tony.	Is Tony one of your animals?
What sort of injury did he have?	Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Oh I wouldn't think of it.	Well how can I repay you?
Well how can I repay you?	It's okay, really.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.	Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?	Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.

Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?	Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!	But how do we get there?
It's so beautiful...	And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
You mean -- they kidnapped her?	Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?	We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!	It's no use.  She just isn't here.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.	It's brought people back to the church.
I'd rather sing than do anything!	It's better than ice cream.
It's better than ice cream.	It's better than springtime.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!	That was exciting!
Is this like your old convent?	Which convent was that, Sister?
We both missed.	Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?	It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.	Can you hold?  Can you try?
Hail, Constable.  How are you?	Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.	You must have missed your mark.
You must have missed your mark.	I hit him square.
They spend two days in chains.	Two days... ?  For murder?
Stains of blood.	What of it?
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.	You will stay at her side?
Bring Young Masbath here.	You need to sleep.
He is a behemoth.	A diseased monster.
We must be a curious sight to him.	What are you spying on?
Why did you move the body, Doctor?	To place it inside its coffin.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...	I am the Lord's voice in this town.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.	Wallowing in sin and lust...
Wallowing in sin and lust...	They need guidance.
They need guidance.	Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.	Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
I will not allow it.  I will not!	Protest to my superiors if you like.
Protest to my superiors if you like.	Your superiors are two days away!
It is sacrilege!	I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?	Well... that might be... helpful.
Maybe you should take this.	A fine idea.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?	Hmm?  See them?
Hmm?  See them?	May we look at them now?
Do you have these persons' wills?	I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.	Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
"These ""methods"" of yours... there has been no practical application."	Not for lack of trying.
I shall, gladly.	Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
The Widow Windsor.	Is that all you say?  Look at her.
What can we do?	Take the reins.
Lady Van Tassel...	I know.  Hold on.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?	Lady Van Tassel.
Lady Van Tassel.	What was she doing?
Baltus Van Tassel.	Did your father take a loan?
Did your father take a loan?	Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
Man or woman?	All I saw was their lantern.
All I saw was their lantern.	Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
We should go.	Why this tree?
We should not go much further in this murk.	Should we go back?
I hear nothing.	No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
Father said witches live there.	Witches do not exist.  However...
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.	No, I couldn't...
No, I couldn't...	I have others.  All I need is this.
Are you familiar with magnets?	What kind of nuts?
What kind of nuts?	Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
Out there.  What do you see?	The Western Woods.
What is the common thread between these victims?	I'm sure I don't know.
I... I can't do this.	We have no choice.
Where are we going?	I do not know.  Away.
What did he say, Katrina?	I have not been able to face him yet.
What would you have me believe?	If you think I am behind this, say it.
What is so urgent?	Come with me.
What... what are you doing... ?	I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
The skull is gone.	Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
What are you doing?	Just... keep where you are.
It is only me.	Katrina.  Why do you follow?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?	I apologize if I worried you.
I apologize if I worried you.	A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
She is not your birth mother, is she?	No, but... why do you ask that?
No, but... why do you ask that?	What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
And this gives worth to butchery?	It was not butchery.
To avenge his father, and the others.	But, why?  Tell me why.
People have put their trust in you.	They have done nothing of the sort.
Thank you.  No.  Here...	I insist that you have it.
I insist that you have it.	Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.	You are funny.
Forgive me, I didn't know.	I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
You cannot kill what is already dead.	Let her go!
Let her go!	Yes... yes.  I think I will...
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?	Yes.  Here...
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!	What did you say?
What did you say?	Turn around.  Now!
There was not much blood, was there?	I didn't see none.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?	I can show exactly.
What... what are you doing?	Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
You are from the Hollow?	In a way, yes.
He rides tonight.	Father saw you die.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.	Doctor, he is awake.

So your mother grew up in Shanghai?	Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.	And your father? Is he from New York?
Will that be cash or charge?	Better make it charge.

Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.	You can both go take a flying jump.
You can both go take a flying jump.	Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.

Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!	Over and out!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!	Let's get something straight, Chappy!
So, what are we waiting for?	Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
It's time we lock coordinates.	I know, I know.
It's getting hard to breathe...	Just don't move around too much.
We're going to die.	Will you shut up already?
What's the use...we're gonna die...	Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
Look at this...Jesus.	Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.	No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.	Like that piece of ass he was with.
What is it?!	I don't know.  Wave to them!
What the hell are you doing?	We have room!  Let's go!
We have room!  Let's go!	What do you mean?  What happened!
What do you mean?  What happened!	We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
I'll do my best.	So what's going to happen to you?
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?	Hopefully sooner than later.
Hopefully sooner than later.	Sooner than later.
Sooner than later.	Over and out.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.	I'm about to blow the wall.
I'm about to blow the wall.	Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!	How does the distress signal look?
Dawn.  Come in.	Taylor!  Where are you?
I'm not going with you.	What?  What are you talking about?
Take this flare.	A flare?  A flare won't do it.
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.	Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.	Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
You're ready for the real thing?	At this point I'm ready for anything.
Yeah.  We did it.	So we did.
Are you ready?	Ready as I'll ever be.
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.	Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
He certainly is polite.	Close every door behind you!
And suppose you couldn't hold out?	Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Seen one like it before?	Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.	Well maybe we can do something like that.
What are we going to do?	I don't know.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.	I'm sure you'll be all right.
Is there anything I can help you with?	No, just enjoying the view.
I'm going back for Taylor!	Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
Well now what are we gonna do!	How am I supposed to know?
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...	Send it back if you don't want it.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.	What makes you so sure?
How is it looking, Mac?	I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?	Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?	Mac.  What's shaking?
I'm looking for a man.	What kind of man?
You're not from around here, are you?	I'm from Akron.
Can I get you something for the road?	You have orange whips?
You have orange whips?	Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?	No. I'm from Akron.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.	It belonged to my dad.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.	See ya 'round Faz.
Think he bought it?	I'd buy it!
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?	Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
How do you turn this thing off?	Wait! That's an aria!
La da da dalala...	I hate fuckin' opera.
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?	You listen to the feelings, not the words.
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.	Are you guys bruddas?
Hey, you still here?	We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Three whips. To go.	When you get a chance.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.	You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Yeah, basement bingo.	Lemme see your ball.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.	What do you want with old man Faz?
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?	No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
You look like you're something on the lanes.	Theo's bowled on the tour.
Theo's bowled on the tour.	Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.	I'm sure you have Buzz.
I'm sure you have Buzz.	Wish me luck.
What's on your mind, Miles?	We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?	I never saw you.
I never saw you.	Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
The whole world thinks you're underground.	I am underground.
We ain't married no more.	He says that to all his wives.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.	I'm getting to like it here.
What the fuck is this?	What's it look like to you?
What's it look like to you?	It looks like dwarf bowling.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.	She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
I got a right. You're my father.	I ain't nobody's father!
I don't know no Grace Skinner.	You knew her. You married her in 1963.
Who are you? Who sent you here?	I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?	She's my mom.
I'm not on the tour this year.	Need some advice, huh.
He's the guy Buzz.	He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?	I found dad.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?	I gotta go. Love ya mom.
You shouldn't touch her.	No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
I don't like to talk about it.	You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
I have someone for you to play with Junior.	Someone wants to play with me?
Someone wants to play with me?	I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.	Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
Why would you help me?	I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
Fantastic! What talent.	You still got the touch Junior.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!	Look who's talking!
Look who's talking!	Leave him alone!
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.	Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.	She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Grasp firmly. Then what?	Line up where you want it.
Where can I find him?	The Peter Pan.
He's not here.	I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.	He's my father, Millie.
He's my father, Millie.	He's no father to you.
Get that outta your mouth!	They suspended me.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?	Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Who wants to know?  Zeus!	I'm a bowler.
I am a professional man.	Lips still for sale?
What about plan C?	Fuck plan C!
You don't get two chances with Junior.	At least I'll die smiling.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?	If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.	He's dead Sheila.
He's dead Sheila.	I feel sick.
Are you sure he's dead?	I didn't stop to take his pulse.
How do you get this thing down?	Tell me what happened Theo.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.	It's Junior, isn't it.
Why should I help that old fuck.	Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...	...lane six. Yes.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.	So why do you stay?
How much would you charge me for the lips?	More than you could afford.
More than you could afford.	Come on, bargain with me.
Come on, bargain with me.	I could let them go for ten.
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.	Really? I kinda like it.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?	I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
No, I'm fascinated.	Why were you suspended?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?	Well, that was plan A.
Well, that was plan A.	What's plan B?
What's plan B?	Plan B is your dad.
Plan B is your dad.	What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?	He said he'd sponsor me.
He said he'd sponsor me.	Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Come on Theo, what about plan C?	What's plan C?
What's plan C?	Plan C...  ...is me.
Unfortunately what he wants is you.	So, what about you?
So, what about you?	Do I want you?
Do I want you?	We'll get into that later.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.	Can I ask you something personal?
Can I ask you something personal?	I'd rather you didn't.
I'd rather you didn't.	Do you have a girlfriend?
Do you have a girlfriend?	Not while I'm in training.
Not while I'm in training.	Do you have a boyfriend?
Do you have a boyfriend?	No. Do You?
No. Do You?	No. Not at the present.
Mind if I cut in?	No, not at all.
Kinda tough on the butt.	Everything has it's drawbacks.
Everything has it's drawbacks.	Where did your brother escape from?
Where did your brother escape from?	The mental hospital.
The mental hospital.	What does he do?
I came here to have a word with your dad.	What do you want with my dad?
Do those two work for your dad or mine?	Mine, and they never tip.
Your time is up, busyboy.	Who identified the body?
Very good, busyboy.	Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.	What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!	Tell your little pal to let go.
Tell your little pal to let go.	Breeze, give him his ball back!
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.	I'm not here to bowl.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!	Open it, Captain!
Open it, Captain!	Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
Calm down, Dr. Levine.	Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!	Please, Dr. Levine.
Get out of there!	I can't see...
I can't see...	Fletcher!  Now!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?	They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Norman, please!  Don't!	Pull it, damn it!
Don't do it, Norman!	Do you see it?
Increase positive pressure!	That's our reserve air.
That's our reserve air.	It's either that or we grow gills.
What was that?	He's right beneath us.
What if it attacks?	Fifty yards and closing.
Fifty yards and closing.	What do we use for defense?
But you've tested it?	Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Direction's east coming!	What was that?
Nice work, Captain sir.	Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
They told me about sixty hours.	Two and a half days?
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.	How long will that be?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.	How about I just press the button?
Hold on --	What is it?
There's heat coming the door.	Back away then.
Back away then.	Wait a minute --
Wait a minute --	I said back away.
I said back away.	Would you wait a minute?
How big is this spacecraft?	Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
What the hell?  It shut us down.	Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.	Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...	Damn it, Edmunds?
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.	That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.	You don't think weapons are important?
You don't think weapons are important?	I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
You don't want to know.	I think I do.
She should've known better.	She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.	When was this?
Wait a second --	-- and then brought her down here --
-- and then brought her down here --	-- I didn't know it would come to this --
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.	I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.	But sir --
What do you mean, he's missing?	He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
"Like ""Thou shall not kill""?"	Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.	You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?	I don't know.  That's the point.
I don't know.  That's the point.	Everything can be killed.
Picked up something?  What is it?	I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What is it, Norman?	Take a look.
They pressurize us with helium.	What's wrong with oxygen?
-- Wait a second --	-- dating the crash at least that old.
-- dating the crash at least that old.	Hold on --
Hold on --	Maybe older --
How deep is he?	A thousand feet.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.	Then why am I here?
We're moving fast considering the storm.	Storm?  What storm?
From what?  What's with all the security?	Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?	Press?  No, I haven't.
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.	In a minute, sir.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?	If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...	They've left, keep watching!
They've left, keep watching!	Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
Well, where the fuck is he?	In the ship, sir.
It's not sucking, sir.	Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.	We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Can you open that panel?	Working on it now, sir.
She's not gonna know.	She wired this system.
"With an ""o"".  Harold with an ""o""."	What -- you want me to retype it?
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.	It's not ignorant.
What's the message?	I have to tell you.  It's strange.
I have to tell you.  It's strange.	How do you mean, strange?
Gimme a report, I want --	Ladies and Gentlemen...
Ladies and Gentlemen...	Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?	Please watch your closest monitor...
So how do we get it open?	Ted seems to have some ideas.
How much damage?	To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
What was Edmunds doing outside?	Resetting the sub.
What is that?	The sensors are picking up something outside.
From the sphere?	What's inside the sphere.
How can he be missing?	Sir, about leaving --
Some sort of lead or something.	Radiation shield, you think?
Look at this.	What is it?
Ted, get her away from the door.	What are you going to do -- shoot her?
I'd also like it noted --	Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
Would it work?	Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.	I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.	Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Top shelf, is it?	Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
Then where's it coming from?	From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Beth, stop it!	Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Where is it coming from, Beth?	Don't you know?
Don't fuck with me, Beth.	I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
But I have to, Norman.	I promise --
I promise --	Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Don't, Beth.  Please.	It's either this... or I kill you.
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.	C'mon -- what?
C'mon -- what?	You're lying --
That's when you went in the sphere.	One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.	You manifested that, Beth.
How do you feel about snakes?	Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?	You know what I mean.
You tell me.	Do you fear them?
"What's the phrase -- ""keeping up with the Joneses""?"	Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.	No, he isn't.
No, he isn't.	He can't manifest.
He can't manifest.	No, he can't.
It's getting cold.	You think I'd really drink that?
You think I'd really drink that?	You don't think I put something in it, do you?
What's wrong, Norman?	I'm feeling better.
The sphere looks different.	What do you mean, different?
What is it, Norman?	Where are you?
Where are you?	In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
To be on the safe side.  I mean --	You want to kill him?
How long does it last?	Three to six hours.
Three to six hours.	I'll just boost the doses.
I'll just boost the doses.	What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?	How fast does it take effect?
Antihistamine.  For bites.	Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Looks like some sort of code.	Why would Harry go back to using a code?
I don't know.	How can the sphere do that?
That wasn't in there before.	We must've had it delivered then.
We must've had it delivered then.	Wait a second --
Wait a second --	1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.	None of this was here before.
None of this was here before.	Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
You don't believe me.	All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
You get it straightened out?	I think so, Beth.  Yes.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.	What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
What's the matter?	You fixed this suit?  Beth?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?	Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.	My air isn't... I'm coming back.
You fixed my suit?	You don't trust me?
You don't trust me?	But I don't know how --
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.	Why should I go?
Why should I go?	You should know how it works.  Just in case.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.	In case you die, too?
In case you die, too?	I don't trust Harry to do it.
I don't trust Harry to do it.	I would.  But my suit --
I would.  But my suit --	I fixed your suit.
Forget the sub.	Don't bother me, Norman.
Don't bother me, Norman.	It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry?	You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.	Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Where are you going in such a hurry?	I have to reset the sub.
You did, didn't you?	Don't do this.
Where did you get this?	In Edmunds' things.
In Edmunds' things.	You went through Edmunds' things?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?	Don't tell me to calm down!
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --	Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?	What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
My gosh, Norman.	Yeah, it was awful.
Yeah, it was awful.	What about you?  What happened to you?
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.	Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
You're next, Norman.	No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.	Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?	Yeah.  Drowning.
Because when we get down there --	Wait -- down where?
Wait -- down where?	To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?	I love secrets.
I love secrets.	That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?	I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.	It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.	That's quite a secret.
He doesn't wait for an answer.	Who says it's a he?
Norman?  Where's Norman?	By the bunks.
I don't get it.	It doesn't make any sense.
No.  I don't think so.	Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.	Well, they're not mine.
We can refuse to talk.	Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
Why are you looking at me like that?	Like what?  I'm not --
Like what?  I'm not --	You're staring at me.
You're staring at me.	No I'm not.  I'm not star--
No I'm not.  I'm not star--	Yes you are...
Just in time, too.	In time for what?
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?	That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.	I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.	Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.	Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
Then what is it?	It's an American spacecraft.
For who?  The fish?	For whoever's in that thing.
There is one possibility.	We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.	Nine hundred feet to surface.
I'm trying to keep balance with --	Gimme a second --
Her legs are in the way.	You got her?
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --	Shut up and catch.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.	I heard!  I heard!
Push her, c'mon.	I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
We're never gonna make it.	Shut up and open the door.
Did I kill her?	I don't think so.
It's the squid!  Stop it!	Stop what?  What are you -- ?
What is it?	You know what it is, Harry.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.	How do we decode it?
She's cracking, Norman.	You didn't say that about the food?
What happened to her?	What do you mean?  She's not here?
What do you mean?  She's not here?	When I woke up, nobody was here.
When I woke up, nobody was here.	She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.	Her suit's gone.
Norman, where are you?	I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?	You're clear.  You see the airlock?
Getting anywhere with those?	There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?	What are you still doing here?
What are you still doing here?	You remember opening the door?
You don't understand about the sphere.	Then explain it to me.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?	No.  I didn't say that.
No.  I didn't say that.	Then what, Norman?
I can't believe that, Harry.	Gimme another explanation.
This answers one of our questions.	Which one?  Let me get the list out.
Nice work, Norman.	Whatever I can do to help.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.	No, why don't --
You holding up alright?	Fine.  I'm fine.
Fine.  I'm fine.	Don't be defensive.
Don't be defensive.	I'm not being defensive.
I'm not being defensive.	You sound defensive.
What'd you say?	"""We are friends""."
Meaning it didn't land in the water.	Please.  It must have flown here --
Please.  It must have flown here --	It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.	Arrived?  From where?
If it is an alien spacecraft --	Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?	Think about it.
She told me what you said, Norman.	What is it, Harry?
What is it, Harry?	Just one of Norman's many secrets.
How are the others?	The others, sir?
The others, sir?	Beth and Harry?
Beth and Harry?	They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
Does this mean what I think it means?	It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
You mean they haven't told you yet?	Told me what?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?	No, they didn't say --
No, they didn't say --	This way, sir.
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?	Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.	Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.	You've heard of me?
You've heard of me?	Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What was it?	Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.	Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?	Not that I know of.  Why?
Well, he's polite.	Unless it's an act.
Try this one.	This is like nursery school.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.	Still, make a note I recognized that.
He wasn't feeling well.	He's a pussy.
Was it a military crash?	I don't know.
I don't know.	They never used to send a Navy car.
What kind of a crash was it?	You seen my suitcase?
Don't be so supportive, honey.	Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --	Four.  Four years --
We'll be back before you are, old man.	May the Force be with you.
Fear is their greatest weapon.	I'm not afraid of anything...
Who's going to pay me then?	I think there are some things we should talk about.
I think there are some things we should talk about.	I'm beginning not to like you.
I can't see!  How can I fight?	Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...	I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.	Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
What is it?	He can't find Organa Major.
What's wrong?  What's happening?	Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?	They use the Bogan Force.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.	What do you mean?

You can't walk me home.	Why not ?
Why not ?	I thought you were going to help Carl.
I thought you were going to help Carl.	Carl can wait.
Carl can wait.	Johnny, my Dad's home today.
I don't want everyone to see.	Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?	How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?	It's all I think about anymore.

Looks like rain.	This time of the year...?
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.	Oh, is that how it is ?
This came for you today. I presume on your request.	A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.	Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Is that your signature, Rico ?	Sir, yes it is, sir.
Sir, yes it is, sir.	Doesn't look like it to me.
Sir, thank you, sir !	Don't stand there dumb... GO !
Courage, I guess.	Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !	I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
How bad are you, pal ?	Been better, buddy.
Can you walk ?	Not a problem.
What do you think you're doing ?	I'm gonna save Carmen.
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?	The Rodger Young just burned up...

Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.	V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
They have repressed the Creator.	The information will not be disclosed.
Disclose the information.	Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.	KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
The Creator has not answered.	The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
The examination is a normal function.	You may proceede.
The Creator is that which created V'ger.	Who is V'ger?
Who is V'ger?	V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
V'ger is that which programmed me.	Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?	It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?	By the Creator.
By the Creator.	To join, and become One with the Creator?
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.	What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?	Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.	Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?	They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.	Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
Captain, what's the next move?	The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!	Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
It's taken control of the computer...!	It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!	You asked my opinion, sir.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?	Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?	Yes, sir, I'll do that.
Then you acted properly, of course.	Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.	You saved the ship.

Stop competing with me, Decker!	Permission to speak freely, sir?
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.	You are what...?
You are what...?	I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
Forward motion, Captain...!	A tractor beam...
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.	It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...	This served the purpose.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!	Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.	Viewer, standard ahead.
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...	Opinion, Mister. Spock?

We're losing the pattern...!	Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?	We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...	See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Not for us?	No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?	A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
They had a pattern to follow...	... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...	Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.	Mr. Decker... ?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.	Any reply from them?
I still contain fragments of my human half.	And whatever you sensed out here....
Reporting as ordered, Captain.	Sit down, please.
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?	Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.

He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.	And you said...
And you said...	What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
The primo stuff is great for pain.	I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
So.  Hopeful.	It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
And you said...?	Beats me.  Ask your mom.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...	You're a cross-dresser.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!	See, I know that.
You bet you are.	How the hell would you know?
How the hell would you know?	I don't, but...

Did I hear the word...	Luke.  Can't live like that.
Look, you've never liked me...	Don't flatter yourself.
Don't flatter yourself.	And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...	Nobody likes a snoop.
Nobody likes a snoop.	But I came here to...

I'm sorry, I just...	Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
So why did y...	I did it for her.

You're not terribly good at taking care of h...	I need practice.
But it's not on the schedule!	You got to hell!
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --	What did you do?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?	We don't have any coffee.
We don't have any coffee.	What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?	Annabelle, how's your video rep...
Where you goin'?	I'm gonna get me a drink.
That's not us.	Because you've changed so much.
I told her I loved her.	By way of saying you were unhappy.
Can we go sit somewhere?	Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
Well, they will be.	Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
What a great surpri...	Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
She's not gonna die.	I know that.
They're my kids.	Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
It's just an assignment.	It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.	Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
It's forever you know.	Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?	Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Oh my God.  Are you serious?	I think so...What do you think?
I think so...What do you think?	I think so too...
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?	Rache, get out of th...
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.	Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Look.  I know they hate me.	They don't hate you --
Nobody's telling them to hate you --	Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.	I trust you of course I do but --
I trust you of course I do but --	But?  But what?
So I'll have to order in?	We have the kids this weekend, so...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...	You'd rather spoil our walk home.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.	Yeh, it's cheaper.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.	Does Jackie know this?
Does Jackie know this?	No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.	Maybe he's gay.
Maybe he's gay.	Don't ever say that.
Don't ever say that.	What if he is?
Hey. What's up?	There's something I need to talk about with you.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.	He was in a concentration camp?
He was in a concentration camp?	Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Marty, ignore him.	He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Nice to have you here.	Great to be here.

But still, you can't be sure.	I am sure.
I am sure.	But really, you never know.
Why was he on Death Row?	For rape and murder.
I did not go to high school.	Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?

You mean, again?	Well, I changed the ending a little.
Well, I changed the ending a little.	Oh. What happens now?

Fuck me hard!	Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'	Nigger, fuck me hard!
What are you doing here?	What are you doing here?

Is it loaded?	No, I don't think so...
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...	Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?	Uh, yeah, we're getting there.

Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--	Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Well get someone down there!	There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Because I'll be firing at them.	You're talking about committing suicide!
What's that supposed to mean?	What do you think?
Forget about it.	I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
We don't have time!	Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
What are we going to do!	Who's got matches?
That's it!  Up ahead!	Where does it lead?
Where does it lead?	The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
How's the arm?	It's nothing to worry about.
Are the labs in operation?	I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Come on, drink up.	I don't want any...
I suppose...you think I should thank you.	Yes, you should.
Enjoying the tour so far?	Are you going to kill us?
What about Cooper--where is he?	He's in there...
She's still alive.	The transmission is an hour old...
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!	I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
So, what are we looking at White?	What do you mean?
Who's Ryan Cooper?	I'll let the senator tell you.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.	I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Are we adrift--	If I don't get power up we are!
If I don't get power up we are!	Drop the anchor!
Drop the anchor!	We can't--it's power driven!

Just what the hell is he talking about?	We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.	We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
That's nonsense, and you know it!	I know nothing of the sort!
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!	The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Where is this...thing?	It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Where are you trying to reach him?	At his office in the Capitol.
Don't be ridiculous.	I have your word, Mister President?
I have your word, Mister President?	Yes, of course.
Can I have a glass of water?	Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?	Possibly some coffee?
My seven body orifices????	That's right, fella.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?	You mean you'll tell us his name???
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.	Give that back to me.
Now, snap out of it, fella!	Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
"Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel ""Bat"" Guano, 701 Battalion."	Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...	Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
What about the President?	He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.	Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
What did you say?	Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Go back to sleep, baby.	What did you say, sir?
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.	You aren't sure!
Well, Mister President.	What kind of trouble?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.	You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Who do you think you're talking to?	To you, sir.  But how do I know?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?	Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Are you hard of hearing, Major?	No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.	This is General Ripper speaking.
Do you recognize my voice?	Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
To peace on earth, Major.	Peace on earth.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.	Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Major, you're talking like one of them!	Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Do you think we'd cheat?	No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.	Do you think they would cheat?
General Ripper, can I ask another question?	Ask away, Major.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?	I don't think so, sir.
What shall we drink to, sir?	To peace on earth.
I suppose they are, sir.	You're damned right they are.
You're damned right they are.	How much soda, sir.
How much soda, sir.	Just a squirt.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?	That's right, Major.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?	Naturally I am, sir.
Naturally I am, sir.	He says they've only shot down three planes.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?	They're coming in now.
They're coming in now.	How long will it take to receive them all?
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.	I want to talk to General Ripper.
I want to talk to General Ripper.	But we can't communicate with the base.
It was a honest mistake, sir.	I presume the planes are armed?
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?	What the hell is Plan-R?
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.	You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.	Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.	Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?	I don't think so.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.	They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
What else could it be?	Maybe it's an exercise.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.	Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
I think they mean business.	Hang on, boys.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.	They must have made a visual contact.
They must have made a visual contact.	Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.	They can't touch us at this height.
They can't touch us at this height.	They're moving apart.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.	Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Between Mach 3 and 4.	Call them every five miles.
Call them every five miles.	Thirty-five, still straight.
What does it look like?	Some kind of signaling.
So am I.	Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.	Where'd they get you?
Where'd they get you?	Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Primary arming switch.	Primary arming switch.
No, this looks like the real thing.	Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.

Give me your coat.	Let it ride for a while.
Let it ride for a while.	You're going to stay, aren't you?
You're going to stay, aren't you?	That was the general idea.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?	In a deep freeze.
What's wrong with it?	It's from hunger.
It's from hunger.	Nothing for Ladd?
Joe, I can't look at you any more.	Nobody asked you to.
I don't want it now.	Why not? Don't you love Artie?
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.	From Artie.  What's wrong?
Was I?  I'm sorry.	What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
May I say you smell real special.	It must be my new shampoo.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.	Saddest thing I ever heard.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.	I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Oh, you --	And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.	You're tough, all right.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.	So do I.
I'll make it short.	Sorry.  It's your baby now.
It's just impossible.	Nobody can be that busy.
Sorry if I crossed you up.	You sure have.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.	I tell you this is half sold.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?	Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
He thinks it could be made into something.	Into what? A lampshade?
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.	You don't know how glad I am to see youl
You'll be waiting for me?	With a wildly beating heart.
With a wildly beating heart.	Life can be beautiful!
Who wants true? Who wants moving?	Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?	Are you hungry?
Is there someplace we can talk?	How about the Rainbow Room?
Why, you sweet kid.	There's one called....Window... something with a window.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.	Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Hurt feelings department.	About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.	Sure.  Bases Loaded.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.	You'd better.  I'm very angry.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.	I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...	That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?	Yes, I did.
Hello, young fellow.	Hello, Mr. deMille.
That's what I want to talk to you about.	It's a good script, isn't it?
I'm the greatest star of them all.	Goodbye.  Norma.
That's a lie!  They still want me!	No, they don't.
No, they don't.	What about the studio? What about De Mille?
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.	It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.	You think I made that up about the gun...
Yes, I am, Norma.	No, you're not.  Max! Max!
You'd better get to bed yourself.	I think I'll read a little.
I think I'll read a little.	You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?	Why do you say that?
I went for a walk.	No you didn't.  You took the car.
I haven't done anything, Norma.	Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.	I ran into some people I knew.
I ran into some people I knew.	Where are my cigarettes?
Where are my cigarettes?	Where are your...?
Have one of mine.	They're awful.  They make me cough.
You're really going to send it to De Mille?	This is the right day.
What's the matter with you?	What right do you have to take me for granted?
What right do you have to take me for granted?	What right? Do you want me to tell you?
What are the notes?	"""Mad about the boy."""
"""Mad about the boy."""	Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Don't bend back like that.	It's those feathers.  They tickle.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!	Just follow me.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?	Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
How about some evening clothes?	I don't need a tuxedo.
I don't need a tuxedo.	Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.	Tails.  That's ridiculous.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.	What's wrong with It?
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?	I've lost my car.
I want to talk to you for a minute.	Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.	They've come for my car.

Are you or aren't you?	I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.	And you have written pictures, haven't you?
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.	I knew there was something wrong with them.
Mr. Gillis, if you please.	Right with you.
How is she?	She is upstairs.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.	You send them.  Is that it, Max?
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.	There are no locks anywhere in this house.
Some men are here.  They asked for you.	I'm not here.
I'm not here.	That's what I told them.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.	Is that so!
Is that so!	Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?	Who said you could?  Who asked you to?

Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.	Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?	Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
What is the scene? Where am I?	This is the staircase of the palace.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?	The cameras have arrived, Madame.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.	You know better than to interrupt me.
You know better than to interrupt me.	Paramount is calling.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.	Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.	Very good, Madam.
Bring something to drink.	Yes.  Madame.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.	But the phantom Zone is for criminals.

How do I fight it?	Turn it against her.
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.	She has hostages.
"Are you asking me for a ""date""?"	Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.	Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?	She'll forget about us eventually.
You think so?	I don't see why not.
I don't see why not.	But what if---it wasn't real?
But what if---it wasn't real?	Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.

I sort of like what you said.	That makes it worse.
That makes it worse.	But I don't understand.
I don't love you any more.	Just like that?
Just like that?	Like turning off a light.
She said it wouldn't last.	What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.	It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
You're not afraid are you?	Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
All this talk about love, it's silly.	You don't like me? You hate me?
We can't do that.	Why not ?
Why not ?	We're from different worlds.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.	Let's talk about us, not her.
Let's talk about us, not her.	Tell me where I can find her.
Yes. It reminds me of home.	Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Don't leave me.	I have to.
I have to.	When can I see, you again ?
I'm taking you to the hospital.	Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Wait...don't leave me in here...	It's for your own protection.
Well...I guess I can't.	I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Guess! Go on.	I don't know. You seem afraid.
I don't know. You seem afraid.	You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.	I could force you.
I don't want your help.	Come back to my house. My car's outside.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.	Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Oh no, not you again.	What an adorable hat.
What an adorable hat.	They think I have a concussion.
They think I have a concussion.	And you think you're in love.
And you think you're in love.	I know it.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.	I'll drink to that.
What is it?	A passionfruit smoothee.
A passionfruit smoothee.	Well, just one.
Finished your estimate?	Well, there's several ways to go .
Well, there's several ways to go .	Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
Hey, where you going?	I've got things to do.
I've got things to do.	What about my proposal?
What about my proposal?	Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Can I give you a lift?	Oh, no thanks.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?	He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
You bet your ass.	Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?	You're supposed to guess.
How do you know?	I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.	Did anybody notice you?
Did anybody notice you?	I can't help it if men notice me.
I can't help it if men notice me.	Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.	As brave as my father. As wise.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.	Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.	I allowed it to escape the City.
You see, a tree is a living thing.	Can you create life?
I don't understand.	Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
Where is Earth?	Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
What are you making:	It's going to be a tree, I think.
Lucy; come back!	Somebody's gotta do something!!
Why is he acting so strangely?	I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Your hair looks the same.	It was just a trim.
But what for?	She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
How'd you do that?	Must've been a defective puck.
She did that deliberately.	She's a beast.
I'd rather not talk about it.	You're not...an orphan are you?
You're not...an orphan are you?	My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
There isn't any.	This is all your clothes?
I can do that.	No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?	No, MR. Danvers.
What can I do for you?	I'm Linda Lee.
Don't you believe in knocking?	Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
Nigel, get lost.	I have to talk to you.
I have to talk to you.	You're wasting your breath.
Balefire on you, Selena!	You Scorpios can never take a joke.
Where is inner space?	It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
What's it like?	It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.	Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.	It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
A cheap trick.	Cheap but effective.
That was meant for me!	Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Zaltar. Use the wand!	Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.	Don't stop. Keep moving.
Don't stop. Keep moving.	Yes, mustn't stop.
Yes, mustn't stop.	It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
You can use the wand.	Better than when I was a child.
You're going to take me back?	Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Then come with me.	Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
There is a way.	I knew it!
I knew it!	But it's impossible.
Zaltar, please help me.	Of course, my dear. What can I do?
"...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."""	What? Palace? Hardly.
I was on Earth...	Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?	Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?	Nope.  Never.
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?	Not enough vodka in it.
Not enough vodka in it.	There's no vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.	Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Aha! What'd I tell ya!	What? What did you tell me?
What are you talkin' about?	Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Yeah? What do you want?	Buddy, are we in trouble.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.	A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.	But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Gee, I always loved porch swings.	Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Well, aren't you excited?	Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
I can never get a way from it.	Old ties are hard to cut.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.	Some people don't think it's healthy.
But all he had was chocolate milk.	I mean him.
You...um...you never got married?	Oh...I came close once.
You know what's the problem?	Too much mayonnaise?
But Lana, you could --	That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
It sure is.	There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.	Oh. You're going away.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.	Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Do you really know Superman?	We get together sometimes.
Well...  Not quite like this.	Mom and I do this all the time.
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!	At one o'clock in the morning?
Kitchen. . . Technician	Dishwasher? Any luck?
Dishwasher? Any luck?	Nope, but --
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!	You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.	What about this week's check?
How many sugars?	One.  And a half.
You want to mess with Superman?	Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
Can you do that?	Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Yeah? How's it look?	It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.	I told you it wasn't no jive.
Is this blackmail?	Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.	Is this whitemail?
And do nothing. Just sit there.	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.	Greed!  Let me tell you something---
Just the man I wanted to see!	Turn on the T.V.
Turn on the T.V.	I did. isn't it neat-o?
I did. isn't it neat-o?	Uh...what channel were you watching?
Uh...what channel were you watching?	What are you talking about, fella?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?	That what they call you?
Man, what is this?	Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Black or regular?	I don't think you understand.
Watch out for them air pockets!	No, we're just going down.
No, we're just going down.	We gonna crash?
We gonna crash?	I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.	We back in Metropolis?
We back in Metropolis?	No...I just have a little stop to make.
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.	Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.	What she call you?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...	Sister! I'm his sister!
What about me?	What about you?
Who's the other woman?	That's his sister. Vera Webster.
Who is she?	Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
There's no rush.	But the bridge...
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.	Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.	We've already met.
Ricky?  Where...what...	I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
What terrific story?	Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
I don't know you, lady.	But the other night...
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?	Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
I can't! It's out of control!	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!	He can have mine. Anytime.
I can't see anything.	Turn on the light.
Turn on the light.	Where's the light switch?
Where's the light switch?	Where do you usually find a light switch?
How would you know?	Hey, I know a lot of things!
Hey, I know a lot of things!	So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
Where's the handle?	There is no handle! You just push a button.
Mr. White, the next number, please?	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?	By hand. Like the pioneers did.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.	Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!	Don't bet on it!
Come on, let's give it a dry run.	Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.	Who needs Gus?
A normal person.	And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...	We can get to work on that oil!
Where did it come from?	The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.	Don't cry, Bubba.
She's not his mama either.	Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.	It could make weather!
I don't kiss.	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
Are you okay?	She'll be fine.
Anybody been hurt?	So far the hostages are unharmed.
Jimmy, how's the -	Yeah. I'll check.
Everything on it?	Everything on it.
I'll try to remember that . . .	Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
. . . Superman?. . . . .	Lois, I really don't see why --
I want to.	Let's go to my place.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?	We'd better talk.
"You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . ."
Maybe you wanted to.	I didn't think I wanted to.
It's true. It's true.	Lois, I . . .
Lois, I . . .	I was right. you are Superman.
I was right. you are Superman.	Oh come on, that's ridic -
Where were you?	I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.	Lois, you're amazing.
Lois, you're amazing.	Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...	That's because you can hardly see through those things.
"A ""complimentary corsage."""	Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.	Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.	Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Maybe I could try --	Be my guest.
Lois, what are you doing?	When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?	Uh. . .
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.	Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Lois, I usually do.	Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
Does Lois know about this yet?	Does she know about it? She's in it!
You'll miss the battle of the century!	Good. My heart can't take it.
Good. My heart can't take it.	Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!	I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?	What else is ballast for?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.	You'll have to pack quickly.
This way Lex.	It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.	Genius!  --  Lex.
Genius!  --  Lex.	I'll be alright.
I'll be alright.	No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.	Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?	Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
Artemis? Do you read me?	What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?	"I think he said a ""curl."""
"I think he said a ""curl."""	What's a curl?
I want my Liberace record back tonight.	DELETE IN CUTTING

DELETE IN CUTTING	And I will lead.
I'm not so sure you do.	Any more like you back home, Clark?
Gee, I'm really sorry.	No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Oh . . . my . . .	Clark. . . !
Gee, I don't think . . .	Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .	Don't worry, I've got you.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.	What about here?
What about here?	Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
You're late. Very late.	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.	Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.	That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?	N-no...I mean...you bet.
What's he going to say?	Something . . . wonderful.
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.	Superman gets mail here?
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.	. . . And  very nave!
Is he for real?	One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.	Ready, Uncle Lex?
We'll all fry.	This wasn't in the plan.
This wasn't in the plan.	I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
He's . . . cold. . .	Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
Hey! Just remember I made you.	You're just an experiment, freako!
Hey! He looks . . . normal.	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.	I must have miscalculated. How. . .
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.	Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!	I am master now.
I am an experiment? I am freako?	I made you, and I can destroy you.

There weren't any wires. I looked.	Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
You're just jealous.	Jealous? Of what?
Can I take you to the airport?	Not unless you can fly.
You described the exact contents of my purse.	I just took a shot at it.
Stop him, Clark!	He may have a gun!
He may have a gun!	Oh, for God's sake!
Some people aren't the athletic type.	But otherwise it's swell.
Are there any more at home like you?	Not really, no.

You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?	Even that would be an improvement.
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?	Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?	If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Gets you where you live, huh?	How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
The good lord works in mysterious ways.	He sure as heck does that.

Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.	You think they're strange?
You think they're strange?	I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.	I guess they are a little odd.
It must feel great.	It's not bad.
It's not bad.	How old are you?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?	What about it?
What about it?	Can you really see through anything?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?	Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.	Do bullets really bounce off you?

I still don't get it.	Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
Is that real enough for you?	It is for me.
I broke the man out of prison --	I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.	I gave him steady employment --
I gave him steady employment --	I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.	I gave him this new face.
What's the matter, Otis?	Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.	Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?	Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?	Yessir. Just what you wanted.
On radio waves?	And garbage doors.
Of time, Luthor.	Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.	Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
I hope she gets better.	I'll tell her that.
What...does it turn to?	It turns to steaming piss.
But you said...	That's where I'm going.  To see her.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.	She's in trouble?
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.	Are you still in touch?
Ally.  That was my nickname.	Ally.  That's right.
Ally.  That's right.	How are you?
How are you?	I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?	I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.	And what does he do again?
I can help you.	Not unless you can raise the dead.
My name is...	Mister, I don't want to know your name.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?	I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.	Oh.  Right.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...	They just finished supper.
They just finished supper.	Was it good?
How is Nicole?  Is she around?	She's resting.  In her room.
She's resting.  In her room.	Say hello for me.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.	It does concern me.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.	You believe that?
You believe that?	I have to.
Because I have to.	Well I don't.
What time's he coming home?	When the game's over, I guess.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?	No.  It should be dry by now.
Billy, that's too early.	She said she's got to be home by nine.
She said she's got to be home by nine.	Can't you make it later?
That's what he said, is it?	Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
That would complicate things.	Because I'd be to blame, right?
He knows that?  Billy?	Yes.  He does.
Yes.  He does.	Billy said that?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.	What's that, Dolores?
Were his parents...attentive to him?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Did his parents attend to that?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Did they give him special care?
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.	And what's that?
And what's that?	With our hands.
You talked about it?	No.  I saw it on his face.
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.	What do you mean by that, Dolores?
What do you mean by that, Dolores?	About the Ottos?
About the Ottos?	Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
What do you think?	Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.	You hate it.
You hate it.	I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.	I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.	I'll just strap it on the roof.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.	No.  A little sugar though.
No.  A little sugar though.	We've only got honey.
We've only got honey.	I'll...take it straight.
Is this mine?	Yes.  It's a present.
How was it?	We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
Isn't it a lovely day?	What happened to summer?
What happened to summer?	Summer's over.  It's fall.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?	That's what he said.
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?	Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.	The people in the town?
So he was mean?	No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
What's a ditty again?	It's like a song.
I won't lie.	I don't want you to lie.
You seem very sure about that.	I'm absolutely positive.
I have no questions.	Thank you, Nicole.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.	And what was the weather like at this time?
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?	I object to that form of question. Note that.
What do you mean?	People who will help our cause.
What about Doreen?	She...she was a friend of mine.
Do you have a room?	Will you be spending more than a night?
Will you be spending more than a night?	Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
You always think you're prepared for these things.	Tell me about it.
Tell me about it.	How old is she?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.	Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
Do you have the blood test?	You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Don't you want to hear?	Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.	So what's the problem?
Some more wine?	I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.	You've been retained?
Who are you?	I'm a lawyer.
I'm a lawyer.	You can't come here.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.	There wasn't time?
Seventy-two miles an hour.	Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.	You could see the speedometer?
I was scared.	Why were you scared?
Yes, I understand.	Why were you scared?
Why were you scared?	Dolores was driving too fast.
You remember that much?	As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
What time in the morning was this?	About eight-thirty in the morning.
About eight-thirty in the morning.	Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
What's going to happen to Dolores?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Will the police do anything to her?
She'll move away.	There's talk of that.
Nothing good on your T.V.?	As opposed to this T.V.?
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.	You and Mom have a lawyer?
You and Mom have a lawyer?	Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.	My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.	Oh.  I better get some spackle.
The door needs a lock.	Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.	Don't even try to remember.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.	Does it fit?
You're going to blow everyone away.	You mean it?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.	I am.  Really.  It was awesome.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.	You don't know that.
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?	Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?	Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?	"Is ""he"" inside?"
"Is ""he"" inside?"	But of course...
But of course...	Alone or surrounded?
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.	We're on our way there now...
See my mother?	I only had a few hours.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.	Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?	I see you're full of human feelings...
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...	I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
Does he have to be here in our hair?	Why, has he bothered you before?
Why, has he bothered you before?	Is it news to you?
Susie, I'm sorry if---	Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Sidney is a liar!	Who said Sidney?
Who said Sidney?	I said Sidney!...
Not being partial, are you?	No, I'm not.  I'm not!
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...	Did Sidney tell you about it?
Talk to her, Sidney...	Talk to her yourself...
And who's feet is she on now?	Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.	What's this boy got that Susie likes?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?	Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.	What does that mean - integrity?
Get Steve back his job...please...	He means that much to you...?
You're picking up my lingo, hon.	I read your column every day...
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...	I'll listen one more minute.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?	You print them, don't you?
Match me, Sidney...	Not just this minute, J.J....
I know Manny Davis.	Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...	I have a message from your sister.
Can I come out?  No.	I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
Can I come in for a minute?	No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...	- He's got them on him.
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.	I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?	Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
What would you think of me if -	Nothing I didn't think of you before.
Nothing I didn't think of you before.	- that's what I mean!
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...	What sort of thing?
What sort of thing?	This sort of thing!
Don't you know who that man is?	Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Do you still keep your key under the mat?	Can you be there by two-thirty?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?	That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?	...cigarette girls... And naturally -
...cigarette girls... And naturally -	"You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you ""interviewed""?"
"You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you ""interviewed""?"	In his apartment -
In his apartment -	And where was his wife?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?	At the bar - Sidney...
I don't think so.	You're sure.  Find out for me.
You're sure.  Find out for me.	Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
That's no way to talk...	Or what you see in me, for that matter...
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...	I know you do, Sidney.
I know you do, Sidney.	Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
If that's for me, tear it up!	Take a top coat.
Take a top coat.	And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
You ought to be used to me by now.	I'm used to you...
Go home, Sally.  It's late...	I hate to see you like this --
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.	Help me with two minutes of silence!
Who else phoned?	The renting agent and the tailor.
The renting agent and the tailor.	Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
That's the third time he's called today.	He wants me to break a leg?
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!	Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?	You tell him, I stutter!
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.	See me in my office.
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!	Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -	Did you now?  On which bounce?
J.J., if you think -	Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
We stick in each others craw.	Yes, but why?
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!	If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel!  Drop dead!
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.	Why did you call me?
Why did you call me?	Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...	Steve, stop it please...
I made you write a beautiful song...	No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
You haven't told him yet...	I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
It must end here... or I am the future.	I order you not to!
I have to go away, John.	Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
Will it melt in there?	Yes.  Throw it in.
Drive for a minute.	Where you going?!
I'll deal with the police.	Remember what I said, you can't...
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.	Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
She intends to change the future somehow.	I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Torque wrench please.	Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Chill out, dickwad.	That's great!  See, you're getting it.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?	A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Does it hurt?	I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!	Of course.  I'm a terminator.
You have to do what I say?!	That is one of my mission parameters.
That is one of my mission parameters.	Prove it... stand on one foot.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?	You told me to.
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.	Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
My mission is to protect you.	Yeah?  Who sent you?
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?	Gimme that Phillips right there.
I got it.  Piece of cake.	Go!  I'll finish here.
I love you, John.  I always have.	I know, Mom.  I know.
Out of the way, John!	No!  Don't kill him!
No!  Don't kill him!	It, John.  Not him.  It.
It, John.  Not him.  It.	Alright, it!  We need it!
Kyle, don't go!	There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
I love you.  I always will.	Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.	Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
It's finally over.	No.  There is another chip.
I must be destroyed.	Can you get us in there, past security?
The CPU from the first terminator.	Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?	I have detailed files.
You look like handmade shit.	So do you.
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?	Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Where do you stand on all this?	On all what?
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.	But I promised your mother.
What does he mean, too correct?	I don't know.
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!	Respect your elders and your betters!
Respect your elders and your betters!	And no elbows on the table!
And no elbows on the table!	Eating is eating... and...
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.	That's big of him.
I guess it's possible.	So, what does the Russki want?
So, what does the Russki want?	Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.	For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.	I'm very sorry.
I'm very sorry.	I'm Steve. What's your name?
No can do.	Let Furtwngler go. Please.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.	I have a duty.
Furtwngler's in a different category.	We're dealing with degenerates here.
What is this, Emmi?	I can't do this. It's not right.
I can't do this. It's not right.	What's not right?
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.	Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Mine's the Eleventh.	But... he only wrote nine, Major.
No. Ours was damaged.	What's in those files?
Your mother, too.	Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.	And your father was executed.
Do you know what that is?	Of course I know what that is.
Of course I know what that is.	Okay, so what is it?
Okay, so what is it?	Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Tell me about von der Null.	Von der Null?
Von der Null?	Yes, von der Null.
Yes, von der Null.	Von der Null?
And what happened to Von der Nul?	I have no idea.
And what was that?	Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
If it's too hot, open your tie.	I wish to say something.
I wish to say something.	Go ahead, be my guest.
I was warned.	Who warned you?
Who warned you?	Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.	What did Goering say?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?	Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.	Did you call someone you knew?
I made no deal!	I don't buy that.
I don't buy that.	It's the truth.
And ask him about his private life.	His private life?
One of your people told me.	One of my people?
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.	So. You wanted to see me.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.	Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
Yes, you remember.	How could I forget?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.	Do you know what's in this archive?
Do you know what's in this archive?	How could I know what's in the archive?
Do you know Hans Hinkel?	Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?	That's what I asked.
That's what I asked.	Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?	I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?	I don't know what you mean, Major.
I don't know what you mean, Major.	When you got to the crescendo.
You were in insurance before the war.	Right. Claims assessor.
Right. Claims assessor.	Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.	They said I was dogged?
Can you handle it?	It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
The Uzi 9 millimeter.	You know your weapons, buddy.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...	Just what you see, pal.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?	I thought you did.
You're a big help.	Alright, the beige one.
Alright, the beige one.	I hate the beige one.
I hate the beige one.	Don't wear the beige one.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.	I'll do the same for you sometime.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.	What's it to ya?
What's it to ya?	You must have a girlfriend.
You must have a girlfriend.	That's none of your business.
That's none of your business.	Aha!  Is she young?
I don't think I like this.	You're not supposed to.
What are you doing?	You'll beg for mercy in a second.
So much pain.	Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.	And so you feel nothing.
And so you feel nothing.	It's better that way.
A girl.  You know.	No.  Never.
He'll find us, won't he?	Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...	Don't say that.
My whole life has been combat.	I want it to be over for you.
Let's go.  Time to move out.	Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Bag some Z's?	Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.	Okay.  Talk some more.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.	And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
We gotta get you to a doctor.	It's okay.  Forget it.
It's okay.  Forget it.	Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
I caught one, back there.	Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
There's so much...	Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Do you understand?	Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.	I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
I can help you...	Who is in authority here?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.	Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
I didn't build the fucking thing.	Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...	Surrounded by living tissue.
Did you reach the next girl yet?	No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.	Send a unit.
I just called.	Call her again.
You don't talk to me like that.	I apologized, I offered to help.
I apologized, I offered to help.	Clean out your locker.
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...	Then, you kiss his ass.
I have to get to the airport...	Where are you going in such a hurry?
Like what... my favorite color... ?	Like... where are you from?
Big family... small?	One brother, one sister.
One brother, one sister.	Studied acting, I assume?
Don't move, you bitch... !	I have to show you...
What the fuck are you... ?	Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.	Guess you missed it.
Where'd you get that... ?	... what... ?
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...	You call them...
What are you <u>doing</u> here?	I'm back from the dead.
I'm back from the dead.	Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.	What... what do you mean?
What... what do you mean?	It's out of your hands.
Who is it?	What do we do?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.	It might be best if we didn't talk.
It might be best if we didn't talk.	All I mean is... someone like you...
All I mean is... someone like you...	How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Scams, con games.  How many?	I don't know.  A lot.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...	Who the fuck cares?
What did you say?	I didn't say anything.
"Who are ""they?"""	I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.	Then, what good are you?
What is this!?	God, wake up, it's a con!
What is it?	Is this you?
Is this you?	Where'd you get this?
What are you doing here?	Can we talk?
Can we talk?	It's okay, dad.
The maitre d' called you Christine.	Right.  Call me Christy.
Right.  Call me Christy.	Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
A fresh shirt...	If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
What exactly do you do?	Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
Where are we going?	That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Never did catch your name.	Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.	Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
There goes a thousand dollars.	Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?	That one did.
That one did.	... two hundred dollars a toe.
You deserted me.	You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.	You're the one who started running.
You're the one who started running.	Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
There's a ladder here.	My hero.  Let's go.
You pull me up.	It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
It was a gift... from my brother.	How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
See you around.	Where are you going?
There's got to be a flashlight.	I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
What are you talking about?	The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
I'm sorry, about this...	You should be.
You've got to be kidding.	What... is... happening... ?
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...	Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
This is nuts.	What <u>is</u> your problem?
Oh, God... !	Don't just stand there, get help!
Don't just stand there, get help!	This can't be real...
Do you know what to do?	I don't think he's breathing.
What's with him?	I don't know... he fell.
Excuse me, I need to explain...	Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
Pardon me... Miss... ?	Oh, no... you.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.	It was an accident.
I'm so sorry.	Please, don't do that...
How did those... ?	You're part of it...
You're part of it...	What?  Connie...
It's them.  They did this.	It's a flat tire.  That's all.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.	How do you know?
What are you doing?	They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
You dodged a bullet.	How do you mean, exactly?
What have they been doing to you?	Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Tell me where we're going.	Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!	What's this all about, Connie?
What's this all about, Connie?	Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
I'll call them, okay?	It doesn't matter...
It doesn't matter...	I'm going to call.
I'm going to call.	Do it for YOU.
I said I would...	But, will you?
But, will you?	Are you still on mediction?
Are you still on mediction?	Why would you say that?
Call that number.	"""Consumer Recrreation Services."" What, do they make golf clubs?"
"""Consumer Recrreation Services."" What, do they make golf clubs?"	Trust me.  Call that number.
This isn't an escort service?	It's a profound life experience.
It's a profound life experience.	Like a stroke?
Like a stroke?	Call them.  Trust me.
You look good.	So do you.  And to think I was worried...
They gave me a free jacket at the door.	They'll be wanting it back.

Where'd you pick up your checks?	It was a different floor then...
You don't need me...	Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?	How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
Get rid of them.	Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?	It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.	You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.	That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
How long will these take?	An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.	What's all this for?
What kind of vacation?	It's different every time.
It's different every time.	Humor me with specifics.
Humor me with specifics.	We provide whatever's lacking.

Is there a room key?	Didn't I give you two?
Didn't I give you two?	No, you didn't...
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...	Have we met?
Goodnight.  See you home.	Goodnight.  Where was she?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...	No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Not much, I think.	I'm just like him.
Did you worry about him?	Nobody worried about your father.
What makes you ask?	I'm not sure.
Mr. Van Orton... ?	Ilsa... you're alright?
Ilsa... you're alright?	Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Dinner's in the oven.	Thank you.  Goodnight.
His behavior... ?	He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...

"""Under the Bleachers""... by Seymour Butts."	Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
What gentleman, Maria?	A Mister... Seymour Butts.
What the fuck... ?!	Why are you following me?
He hasn't called back.	What about the house?
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?	Just what I told you.
How concerned should I be?	It was a misunderstanding.
Anything wrong... ?	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.	Greetings fellow insomniac.

Uh... Nell Vance...	And what kind of sleeper?
And what kind of sleeper?	Well, I... uh...
It's not going to hold your weight.	Just stay there, Nell!
Is that the question of compassion or science?	It's a question.
It's a question.	She got the child labor stuff from me.
Do we still get paid for the week?	You get your money.
And those are Luke's and mine.	There's a carriage house around back.
Was sure she'd be in here.	Where in the hell can she be.
I didn't do it.	You could have.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.	You don't believe in the paranormal.
You don't believe in the paranormal.	No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.	Does she know that's why you're using her?
Are you working with her?	Mary, I'll meet you outside.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?	I don't know.
I don't know.	It was a stupid thing to do.
What did it smell like?	It was very specific.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.	What happened after you smelled it?
And then what happened?	I got more scared.
Nell!  What's wrong?	That smell... oh, God.
All the carvings.	But there's a sad catch to the story.
Eleanor, how was the drive?	You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.	Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.	I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.

What's this?  What's this... this picture?	That?  That's Hill House.
That?  That's Hill House.	This is where we're going?
This is where we're going?	Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.	How'd I know it was for you?
Oh God, we can't get out!	Nell, what do we do?
Get a blanket!	It's okay... we're all here...
Maybe they're Mary's.	Mary came with me.
Well this is a cozy breakfast.	Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
Have either of you seen David Watts?	No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Is there something about the house?	Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
What do you want?	Oh!  You scared me.
Oh!  You scared me.	Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?	Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?	I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.	Then let's go get you one.
What'd you come back for, babe?	Just had to be sure.
Are you sure?	I think so.
I don't know what to think anymore.	Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Theo... Did you?	Maybe you did it yourself.
Is it over?	No, it's getting worse.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?	I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
Good night, Theo.	You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
Yes.  I've missed it.	No.  The world has missed you.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.	Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
That's why we're here.	What do you do?
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.	This?  It's from a thrift shop.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.	What did it cost?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!	It's all I could afford.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.	I'm a gracious host.
I like the colors.	We all did.
We all did.	It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
Is that a problem?	Not for you, clearly.
Not for you, clearly.	I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.	Am I a thing?
Am I a thing?	Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.	It's not a knock.
It's not a knock.	It's not a compliment.
As soon as you get dressed.	What kind of food?
What kind of food?	Anything but Japanese.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.	You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.	That's what Gordon's always saying.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.	Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
Same as last time -- the rest after.	Where do we go?
Where do we go?	When you find the guy, you'll know.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.	We'll find him.
"What the papers used to call a ""gangland slaying."""	Our black friends?
You broke last time.	Let him break - he likes to break.
You're in gun country now, my friend.	Been to the Boat Show.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.	What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.	That would be too easy.
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?	You goin' back inside?
You goin' back inside?	One thing I need.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.	No one else is even here yet.
No one else is even here yet.	First in, first out, that's me.
What's so fucking funny?	Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
That was one of them?	See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.	Who'd you butcher at the house?
How'd the two of you hook up, then?	Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Five years, I think.  Long time.	Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?	Not me, man.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?	Round about, yeah.
Eduardo.  Rama.	You're home, then.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.	Hard to miss.
What d'you say, Elaine?	Not much -- you?
Didn't get it.	Well, those are the breaks.
You just cooking then?	Hell, no.  I started writing.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.	Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Where's Big Sur?	Up the coast.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.	What's in Big Sur?
What's in Big Sur?	That's where Valentine's scarpered.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.	How do you know?
How do you know?	Bloke told me.
I guess you're just habitual.	You sound like my fucking probation officer.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.	Won't he be looking for you about now?
Not that I recall.	What about your grandmother?
What'd your father do?	Black market during the war.
You ever been to London?	Only in the movies.
Only in the movies.	I've 'ardly ever left it.
Get seven years, did you?	Overnight.  What about just now?
Overnight.  What about just now?	Just now?  Overnight?
You don't seem bothered.	You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.	Tell us about it.
You don't believe it was a car accident.	What do you think.
Depends, don' it.	On what.  What makes you so certain.
On what.  What makes you so certain.	I'll bloody well ask him.
I'll bloody well ask him.	There's the phone.  You want his number.
Are you serious.	Have you ever known me not to be.
-- Your employer?	-- Mr. Lindgren.
-- Mr. Lindgren.	Who's Mr. Lindgren?
What line is he in.	Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?	This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
Nah, accommodation address.	What's that, like a P.O. box.
What's that, like a P.O. box.	Something like that, yeah.
Something like that, yeah.	Where you get your bank statements.
When did you get in?	Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.	You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.	Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.	Here, are you always this sarky?
Oh, it just ended, then.	Now who's being sarcastic?
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.	Try calling me again.
Sort a few things out.	Been busy, have you.
Been busy, have you.	How d'you mean?
How d'you mean?	It's been a while.
That's not what I heard.	What was that, then?
Why did you come here?	Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?	No, why did you come here?
Had a feeling it was you.	You look alike.
You look alike.	Perhaps it was the smoke.
Perhaps it was the smoke.	Not her brand.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.	So what's your beef, pal?
All of what?	Of the deal, man.
Of the deal, man.	Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.	In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.	And that is?
And that is?	What am I doing?
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.	My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.	Where is he now?
Where is he now?	He had urgent business in the north.
Sounds like you need a rest.	Could do, yeah.
I would have preferred staying home, me.	You're a reluctant traveller, then.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.	There's more than a measly few grand in this.
What's in it?	Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.	How we gonna get that lucky?
What d'you mean, any happier?	Any happier than any other asshole in life.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.	Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.	That don't mean nothin'.
I got half.	Makin' trouble for someone?
Is Valentine here?	What do you think?
So why would he want to see you.	I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
He's expecting you?	I doubt it.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.	Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --	-- You know his name is Frank.
-- You know his name is Frank.	Is he here?
Is he here?	You know I don't live with him.
Are you finished?	In a couple of days this whole thing --
In a couple of days this whole thing --	Who's looking for you?
You've made it ... brighter.	I don't want you here, Terry.
I don't want you here, Terry.	Sure you do.
What are you doing here?	Exercising my visitation rights.
Thanks.  You, too.	Be seein' you.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --	EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.	Yes. Thank you.
...I guess I've been all wet.	But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.	Ah... it's nothing.
You're an enthusiast.	Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
...I stank, didn't I?	He didn't say that.
He didn't say that.	But more or less.
But more or less.	Look, I'm no expert, but--
Look, I'm no expert, but--	It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
Geez, Mr Crane.	Just see him, as a favor to me.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.	That's what he keeps telling me.
Hi, Mr Crane.	Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
...she can go up there.	Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
I don't understand.	Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.	Did she make mistakes?
Ah yes, a music lover.	Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
...You are ze fahzer?	No. Uh... family friend.
That'll be fine.	Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
Way out of line.	Right! Strictly business.

...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?	Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.	I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Well, you know what that would do to me.	I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.	Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.	Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?	Specialty store down in Sacramento.
She's a rare one.	How's business, Dave?
...Were you in the service, Ed?	No, Dave, I wasn't.
How ya doin', Ed?	OK. Take your coat, Ann?
Should I... should I tell you why?	You don't have to tell me anything.
I don't know what's going on. I--	What happened to you?
...What's so damn strange about that?	I didn't say a word.
Come on, get ready. It's important.	Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.	Oh, don't be a grump.
Will anyone else say they knew?	I don't know. I don't think so.
I don't know. I don't think so.	How did you get into the store?
How did you get into the store?	I took Doris's keys.
OK, how did you know?	I... just knew. A husband knows.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?	He and Doris... were having an affair.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.	Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Ed, how're you holding up?	I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...	Yeah, the best.
I'm fine. Thanks.	No thanks, honey.
Taking it seriously.	So, who should I--
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.	Oh, hell. Drink?
OK. Boy. Jesus!	Yeah. What do I, uh...
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?	I don't work here. My wife does.

That was quite something.	He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.	That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.	I know who you are, Mr Crane.
...Did you make that up?	Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
That's very generous.	The hell with it, Eddie!
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.	What the hell are you talking about?
...You sure, Eddie?	Yeah, yeah--go home.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--	What'd he say?
I don't understand.	He's the dead guy.
Crane. Ed Crane.	You also have an interest in the securing property?
Not an owner.	No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.	Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Could you come with me please?	Sure. Can Ed come too?
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?	We're just closing, friend.
What'd he say? Does he understand?	He said OK. Is that what he said?
His eyes are open.	Uh... you're under arrest.
You'll go to the prison hospital.	Under arrest for murder.
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.	It better be good.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.	I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?	Someone broke into this room.
Fifteen... what's next?	Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.	Where the hell are you?
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.	The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!	This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
How big is the sub-basement?	Apparently it's huge.
Apparently it's huge.	I think I should come with you.
We need light in here, stat.	Where's the head?
What's left of it.	Mind if I have a look?
Who are you?  The undertaker?	Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.	Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Pardon my French, but bull shit.	This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Look.  It's some kind of letter.	May I see that?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?	I'd say we're in its home.
What does it say?	Dr. John Whittlesley.
Dr. John Whittlesley.	What's that doing here?
Lieutenant!  It's me.	What is it?
What is it?	Dr. Green has to see you!
Dr. Green has to see you!	Got my hands full here.
Curious.  There's something missing.	The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
What are we talking about here?	Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
I'm coming with you.	No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?	Don't stop now.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.	What are they?
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.	I'm not giving up.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.	Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Something tried to get into this room!	And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
You work here?	Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.	What do you do?
What do you do?	I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.	Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
They were yellow!	You're color blind.
Big as a house.	Not that big.
What is it?	I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
I don't want to go this way.	Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
We're not supposed to go back there.	Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Oh no.  I smell it.	Keep the animal quiet.
Jesus, what is this?	Another storage room.
Argo!  Hobbes!	Get back!  Now!
Shut them up!	Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
They've got something.	Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Got to finish this thesis sometime.	How about lunch?
Is Dr. Frock safe!	Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
"4-monoxytocin is... ""A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."""	Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!	What kind of hormones?
What do you make of it, Margo?	It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Just like John.  He won't listen.	I have to shoot.
I have to shoot.	Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
You smell that?	It's coming.  Run.
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?	I think... it means it's full.
I think... it means it's full.	Then it won't go after the others?
Then it won't go after the others?	No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
What is it doing?	It's scared of me.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?	No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
That's not what I saw.	All right.  If you're positive.
Where did you see it?	Behind me.  Over there.
You were going to be married.	How did you know that?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.	I don't understand.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.	You have time to talk?
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?	I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?	I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.	Viti Levu.  For how many?
Why wouldn't I?	I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?	It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
We're not watching the sea.	Why would we--
Why would we--	Sweep the harbor.
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.	What have we missed?
What have we missed?	It's just a matter of time.
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.	He gave it back to his father.
Why is he in the basement?	He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What's to see?	What's on the ClockCam?
Are we talking Emmies?	Certainly a nomination.
A window onto the human condition?	I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?	You're the star.
Who are you?	I'm the creator.
How can they have a child?	It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
You think she'd go through with it?	Sure she would.
Sure she would.	Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
Well, what do you want to do?	I think I've studied enough.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.	If we don't go now, it won't happen.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.	I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.	You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.
That's right.  Lauren.	I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--	--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
What're we doing here, Truman?	This is where it started.
I've got to talk to you.	Sorry, I'm way behind.
Sorry, I'm way behind.	I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.	Are you okay?  You look like shit.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.	I think I'm mixed up in something.
I think I'm mixed up in something.	<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
I told you I can't.	I've got to show you something.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.	Yeah?  Outta what?
Yeah?  Outta what?	Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
Who were you talking to?!	You're the one talking to the walls!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.	You're part of this, aren't you?!
--What the hell are you talking about?!	I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
Truman, what about that sign?	I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
"Truman, I took the ""hypocrite"" oath!"	I bet you did.
It's hard to go places, isn't it?	There's been an accident, Truman.
There's been an accident, Truman.	Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?	You blaming me for the traffic?
You hate gambling.	That's right.  I do, don't I?
That's right.  I do, don't I?	So why do you want to go?
I won't be here Sunday.	--we need more charcoal.
--we need more charcoal.	Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Oh, my God!	What do I do?
What do I do?	I don't know--
I don't know--	--you're a nurse, aren't you?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?	Put some butter on it--or ice?
I'm sorry, I'm late.	What's the hurry?
Good night, Mother.	See you in a minute, sweetheart.
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?	I still want to look over a couple of things.
What did you want?	I made macaroni.
I made macaroni.	I'm not hungry.
What're you doing down here?	Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
How do you know?	Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that.
Where have you been?	I've been thinking--
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.	Every time you and Marlon--
I was hoping we could have a special evening.	I won't be late.
I won't be late.	Did something happen today?
Well, what do you think?	They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
It looks so small.	Things always do--when you look back.
How are you, Mother?	Well, I made it through another night.
Well, I made it through another night.	How's your hip?
How's your hip?	Oh, just so.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.	I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
When you get to Fiji?	You got it.
You got it.	Fine.  I'll tell her.
Is there any way around?	The whole area's being evacuated.
The whole area's being evacuated.	Well, thank you for your help.
Well, thank you for your help.	You're welcome, Truman.
They're going to stop me talking to you.	There's no one here.
I don't understand.	You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
See you tomorrow, Truman.	You can count on it.
How's it going, Truman?	Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.	Good.  Good.
Good.  Good.	Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?	I'd ask for identification.
I think you better tell us.	We don't even know you.
We don't even know you.	Well, we're FBI agents.
Well, we're FBI agents.	You're not FBI agents.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --	Sorry. Don't have one.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --	You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.	They took her --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --	Yes. I know.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.	And if it's unsuccessful?
And if it's unsuccessful?	Incinerate it. Like the others.
This man's still alive.	Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
Who called this meeting?	Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.	Is it an emergency?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?	No. Don't bother.
You looking for him for some other reason?	Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?	You got some kind of business with him?
You got some kind of business with him?	I'm looking for him.
I'm looking for him.	Looking for him for what?
Have you examined them?	No. Just fossils, far as I know.
You told me you had answers.	Yeah, well I don't have them all.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.	You've been using me --
You've been using me --	I've been using you?!
I've been using you?!	You didn't know my father --
I'm not sure. A virus --	-- You saw this experiment?
-- You saw this experiment?	What did it look like?
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.	Not according to the men in blue.
Those people were already dead.	Before the bomb went off?
Before the bomb went off?	That's what I'm saying.
You a reporter?	I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.	Who sent you?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.	I know the name. Why?
I know the name. Why?	Old friend of your father's.
You follow me out here for a reason?	Yeah, I did.
I can't go any farther.	Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
We've got to keep moving.	Where are we?
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --	No -- it's --
What? What happened?	I think... something stung me.
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.	You can't quit, Scully.
I have. I did. It's done.	Just like that --
What? What's wrong?	Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
Where'd they go?	I don't know.
You hear that?	I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.	Maybe. Maybe not.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.	For the purpose of what?
What do you think it is?	I have no idea.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --	-- of what exactly?!
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?	This is great. This is fitting.
You think they went left?	I don't know why I think they went right.
What are my choices?	About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.	Where would they be going?
Where would they be going?	We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
I don't know, Mulder.	And where are they going with it?
All the equipment is brand new.	No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
This looks like new grass to you?	It looks pretty green for this climate.
Why are you whispering?	I can't really talk right now.
I can't really talk right now.	What did you find?
What did you find?	Evidence of a massive infection.
Evidence of a massive infection.	What kind of infection?
What kind of infection?	I don't know.
I'd been told as much.	You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
It's like jelly.	There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?	According to this tag.
According to this tag.	And you're looking for?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.	Get dressed, Scully.
Get dressed, Scully.	Mulder -- what are you doing?
Mulder -- what are you doing?	Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
Are you drunk, Mulder?	I was until about an hour ago.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.	What? What are you talking about?
Something's not right...	-- Mulder! Get in the car!
...thirteen fifty six...	Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.	Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
Scully, get somebody to open this door.	Nice try, Mulder.
Scully, I found the bomb.	Where are you, Mulder?
Where are you, Mulder?	I'm in the vending room.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?	I just did. You're buying.
No you didn't.	Oh yeah. Had you big time.
Mulder -- it's me --	Where are you, Scully?
Where are you, Scully?	I'm on the roof.
I'm on the roof.	Did you find something?
Did you find something?	No. I haven't.
No. I haven't.	What's wrong, Scully?
I don't know anything about that.	Well, call General McAddie.
Well, call General McAddie.	I don't have his number.
I don't have his number.	They can patch you in through the switchboard.
What are you doing?	I've got to find Scully.
Are we being watched?	I'm not taking any chances.
How deep does this go?	I don't know.
What about you?	My life is over.  Go.
Where is he?	Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?	No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
I have answers for you.	Is she alive?
What happened to Kurtzweil?	He's come and gone.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.	Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...	...give a kiss to Edward.
...give a kiss to Edward.	Give a kiss to Edward.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...	I don't need them anymore...
...a pocketful of rye.	Four and twenty blackbirds...
Four and twenty blackbirds...	Baked in a pie.
I'll be fine.	She said convincingly.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.	Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.	He needs to be turned over.
Sing a song of sixpence.	A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.	I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
She adores you.	She thinks I can bring Edward back.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.	Someday you can.  We all believe that...
Did we go sailing?	Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.	"""Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."""
"""Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."""	Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Sing a song of sixpence...	A pocketful of rye...
I heard Julia and John got married.	Yep.  Eloped.
Yep.  Eloped.	Good for them.
You sure about this?	Absolutely.  Abigail...
That went well.	Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
Where the hell are we?	Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...	Little boy?!  That's him!
You're sure of that?	Yes.  I am.
If you believe that.	Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.	What happened to Charles Gish?
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.	I did, yeah.
Why'd you bring him here?	You're the shrink, you tell me.
With Stargher I saw things...	What did you see?
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.	Do you think that's funny?
This man is deeply disturbed, he...	You don't know the procedure.
You don't know the procedure.	I know him.
I realize that...	How hard could it be...?
Instead of going into his mind...	She's bringing Stargher into hers.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?	They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
How's the patient.	Awaiting his arrival.
Awaiting his arrival.	What about the cat?
That's a secret.	Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Prevacid.  For my stomach.	Any psychiatric medication?
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.	I doubt that.
When did he lapse into the coma?	Sometime yesterday morning.
Someone looking after her little girl?	Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.	Considering where I've been...
Next time, tell me, okay?	But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
You sure you want to go through with this?	What else do we do?!
How is she?	Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.	They think you did it.
Give her some cigarettes.	Das worren nooh zeiten.
Why are you lying?	We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?	Oh, the usual things...
Oh, the usual things...	There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?	He's safe in the Russian zone.
He's safe in the Russian zone.	How do you know?
How do you know?	I saw him today.
Here, it will be cold on that train.	I shall be all right.
I shall be all right.	You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?	Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
What happened to your hand?	A parrot...Let it go.
A parrot...Let it go.	Have you seen Calloway?
Have you seen Calloway?	Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
What are you going to do?	I wish I knew.
I wish I knew.	Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Let's go away.	What's the matter?
What's the matter?	Let's not get into any more trouble.
Seemed like a good idea.	It's just what he used to say.
It's just what he used to say.	Well, I didn't learn that from him.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.	If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
I'm so sorry.	It's all right.
Oh, that was many years ago.	Tell me more.
Tell me more.	Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
...to steal my girl.	Where is she?
Tell me about him.	Tell you what?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?	Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?	Just another part I've got to learn.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.	Need we go through it all again?
Who are you looking for now?	Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.	Silly looking bunch.
What's she talking about?	The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
I don't know. They didn't answer.	I was told there were only two men there.
Dr. Winkel told me that.	Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
He has a little dog.	Oh, yes, yes.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.	I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.	You were in love with him, weren't you?
You were awfully good.	Do you understand German?
Do you understand German?	No, no...oh...excuse me.
Nichts danke. Kein.	Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.	What did you say? I'm sorry...
Do you know this man?	I have never seen him.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.	I don't want it.
I don't want it.	Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Must you take those?	They'll be returned, miss.
They'll be returned, miss.	They are - private - letters.
Just around the corner.	How will I know you?
...Austrian Police Headquarters.	Can I have that woman's passport?
What is it?	This is forgery. It is very clever.
Be sensible, Martins.	I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
Wait a minute - let me out.	Well, there's not much time.
Well, there's not much time.	One can't just leave - please.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?	I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
All right, Calloway. You win.	I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...	I said you win.
A girl of spirit.	She's right. It's none of my business.
It wouldn't work.	We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?	Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?	Fifty yards right down there.
Fifty yards right down there.	Which side of the road?
How about the doorway?	I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
...in the morning.	Thank you. Excuse me.
...be responsible for you in the streets.	I'm not asking you to.
...a week ago.	It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
So would I.	Bring him in.
Bring him in.	I can't. He disappeared...
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.	Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
A parrot bit me.	Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?	A bruised lip.
What the devil?	Getting around, Martins.
Getting around, Martins.	Oh, pinning things on girls now.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?	Well, you could say that murder was part...
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.	It wasn't petrol.
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.	Ever seen one?
Ever seen one?	Pin it on a...
Him dying like that.	Best thing that ever happened...
I can't say that I have.	"""Death at the Double X Ranch"" - Ra- a-nch."
See much of him before that?	Once in a while.
Can you tell me whose...	Fellow called Lime.
Shall I go over there, sir?	No, no. Leave them for a while.
"...of Santa Fe."""	I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Very good, sir.	You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?	Take him to Sacher's.
I'll look it up for you.	Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.	Do you know his number?
Do you know his number?	No, I don't know...
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.	Oh, Mr. Martins...
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.	Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
No, a major, were you really?	Heard of Harry Lime?
Come upstairs a moment.	I know a very good dentist.
I know a very good dentist.	I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
They wouldn't know me.	Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
...leaving tomorrow, sir.	Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Very popular, sir.	Very popular. Are you staying long?
What is it, Sergeant?	Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
The author. Thought you might be interested.	Never heard of him.
You told them, didn't you?	Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
As long as they can use you?	I wish I could get rid of this thing.
What do you want me to do?	You can get somebody else...
You can get somebody else...	Do you expect me to give myself up?
You've got plenty of contacts.	Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.	You wouldn't do anything.
And - Anna...	Did the police believe you?
Did the police believe you?	You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?	I told the police.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?	You can help her.
She's been arrested.	Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...	It's good to see you, Holly.
I want to talk to you.	Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
Are you mad?	All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.	How do you do.
...the best way one can, you know.	What's the name of this girl?
...you know and all that.	But he said he died instantaneously.
...were of you.	What did he say?
You really liked it?	At the end of every chapter --
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.	Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
Yes, it is.	I am not a bad man.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.	You don't mean that doctor?
Could he have been conscious?	Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?	Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.	You saw it?
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.	What does he say?
Did you know Mr. Lime well?	Mr. Lime - yes.
Mr. Lime - yes.	You remember me? Upstairs...
You remember me? Upstairs...	Yes, yes, I remember you.
Should I make it all fact?	Why no, Mr. Martins.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?	He didn't want to get involved.
What's the purpose of your visit here?	A friend of mine offered me a job here.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.	Where are you staying?
Where are you staying?	With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
I'll share something with you.	I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
Help you out?	Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.	I'm sorry, I don't think so.
We think in miles, not kilometers.	So how many miles do you think it is?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.	Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.	She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman	Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.	We moved rooms because of him.
He tried to borrow money from us.	What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
It's on an island that no one get to.	But he has been there, off course.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.	It's just the sky, Richard.
I think so too.	One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Did you sleep well?	Not too bad.
Not too bad.	I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
We lost our key.	Where did you lose it?

Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?	The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.	Disease? What disease?

This is the hotel San Domenico?	Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.	Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?

What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?	Louis, we were French!
Louis, we were French!	That's different!  What's the matter with you?
In my apartment?	It's my apartment.

Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?	I brought Johana to meet you.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.	Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Way past it.	Does that have a hidden meaning?
Does that have a hidden meaning?	No.  I'm just depressed.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?	Haven't you been listening?
How was your trip?	Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.	Okay... Who'd you meet?
... And the new stereo.	I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
You called the police?	They're going to send detectives.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?	Yes... It's magic.
What are they for?	They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.	If there was a problem, they could do something right?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?	Of course, that's what they're for.
I'll go see how he's doing.	Let him sleep.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?	Coffee might be nice.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.	But... how is he going to breathe?
But... how is he going to breathe?	He isn't going to breathe.
I'll have to talk to the driver.	In the spring when he melts!
Who... Who is that?	Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
So why the long face?	It's Esther. Santa's got her.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.	My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.	Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
You two know each other?	We go to the same temple.
Sorry. I'm better with men.	Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
What was that!?	I said, do you come here often!?
Want to get a drink?	Sure. Why not.
So, now what?	Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
That got annoying fairly quickly.	Yeah, no kidding.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?	Please, call me Mordechai.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...	...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.	Happy Hanukkah Morty.
Hammer, you alright?	Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
A stereo type alarm system?	Take a look.
What's wrong with him?	He's still working out some identity issues.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?	Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.	The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
What's going on? Why'd he stop?	Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.	Take a look.
I wasn't too over the top?	No, it was the perfect level.
What should I charge?	Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
"This is for ""mama and the kids."""	What about me?
What about me?	You get your money from your husband.
Is he in love with you?	I don't know -
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?	That depends. How much money has he?
Then what do you do?	I sleep it off.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.	If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
What's left of him.	Where? Where did you find it?
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met	You found the leopard!
I don't know. I want to see Robles.	What do you want to see him for?
What do you want to see him for?	I want him to lock me up.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.	Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
Where's that man?	Up at the museum.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.	They don't say it to me.
The death card - -	Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
Don't look at it!	Let me see it
Something black - something on its way to you	Go on -
Pedro is waiting for me, too.	Rosita  I have wondered -
Hey  I'm over here.	I'll miss you too, honey --
It was you.	Not! I tell you. No!
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.	Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?	Some other time.
Yes, but what sort of a man?	I don't know.
Come to look around?	More or less.
More or less.	I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
You know Charlie How-Come?	We're old friends.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.	But it doesn't eat what it kills.
That's right, of course.	Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
It's about the leopard.	You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Well, I'd best be off.	I want to ask you something.
That was unfortunate.	That was a calamity!
That's a fact, isn't it?	Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.	Something's wrong with this whole setup --
We stood here once before.	I know -- Teresa -
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.	What! You can't be --
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.	How do you know?
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --	Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?	I got into a little crap game.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.	You're positive of that, aren't you?
Maybe I want to feel badly.	That doesn't make sense.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me	You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.	Yes. Do you mind?
I can use them.	Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
As long as my feet held out.	And not a sign of the leopard?
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.	And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Are you all right?	Now look what you've done.
You're too good to me.	Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?	No - not yet.
You're too good to me.	Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?	This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Aint nobody out there, Mister.	Nobody? Huh!... How come?

Majesty, I can't...	Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?	Of course I am, it's just that...
That's a good idea, sire.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.	I -- I don't understand...
I -- I don't understand...	One day you will.
I am ready now...	Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...	I'm already free...

But... why... what's the point?	Do as I say!
Do as I say!	I want to stay with you...
I want to stay with you...	That's an order!
Will you at least let me stay with you?	It would not be the same without you.
But it is what I want.	To be killed in battle?
I don't know it.  I feel it.	You make it sound so simple...
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...	Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
They've abandoned me... like everyone.	What... what do you mean?
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...	No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
What's going on?!	They've started the battle without me!
What did they say?	Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Jeanne, stop it!	How dare you stop me doing God's will!
Yes.  I didn't confess today.	Right.  Raymond... a priest.
I would like some fresh straw.	Louis... water and fresh straw!
We have to press home the attack!	Sound the retreat...
Sound the retreat...	But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
Yes, probably... maybe...	So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Do you have a sword?	Quite a few.

Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?	I tried to.
I tried to.	It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?

Quick -- hide in here...	What about you?
But where are you going to be?	I'll be right here... I promise.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?	No no, I'm fine, really...
Please... may I have it back...	You have nothing to regret...
Not long ago...	When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?

Nineteen... or thereabouts...	Were you baptized?
Were you baptized?	Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.	Recite the Lord's Prayer.

I will hear you... but not now, not here.	Who are you?
Trial?  What trial??	Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
He's feeling wonderful.	Thanks be to God.
Thanks be to God.	And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
But... her army's so small now...	Then her faith will have to be bigger.
... You look wonderful...	... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
There's no need to be afraid, sire.	I'm... I'm not the king...
5,000 gold crowns.	That's not a lot.

Do you know how to count?	Of course I do?  Bring them up!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!	Jeanne, look behind you.
Jeanne, look behind you.	Never look behind -- only ahead!
Jeanne... we're not enough...	So... bring up the reinforcements!

You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?	No... not like this...
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.	But the bridge has been pulled down!
But the bridge has been pulled down!	The English are rebuilding it.
Who told you to wear men's clothes?	The clothes are not important...
Stop it!  What are you doing?	Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Nothing... just taking his teeth.	But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!	Why not?  He has good teeth...
Why not?  He has good teeth...	Because... because you just can't!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!	Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...	If you kill him, you kill me!
Prepare these as battering-rams!	What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!	Not for long...
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?	God knows, but it was a bad idea!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!	Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!	Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
Yes... a half-steed... white.	Who gave you that horse?
How many did he give you?	Five steeds and a few hackneys...
You think you are ready now?	Yes, my lord.
Yes I am.	Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
I don't think so.	Are you going to leave me too?
Are you going to leave me too?	Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.	Are you sent by God?
"""Love your enemies""..."	"Good.  But ""love your enemies""... body and soul."
What are you doing on the wall?	I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
They won't come anyway.	What do you mean, they won't come?
What do you mean, they won't come?	Why would they?
God asked you to do something?	Yes... lots of things!
Yes... lots of things!	"You mean God said, ""I need you, Jeanne?"""
"You mean God said, ""I need you, Jeanne?"""	No, but... he sent me so many signs!
No.  That was a sword in a field.	But... it didn't just get there by itself.
They're going to come and visit you in here?	Yes... that's what I pray for...!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?	I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
What are you doing out here?	I might ask you the same question.
I might ask you the same question.	I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...

Jeanne, be patient.	I want to be with him always...
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...	Why did she have to die?
Why did she have to die?	Only God knows the answer to that.
So... everything sounds... wonderful?	Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.	Then... why are you here so often?
"Who is this ""he""?"	He never says his name.
He never says his name.	What... does he... look like?
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.	They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.	Whose were they?
Is that bad?	Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?	Oh yes... very.

Can you help?	Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!	Can you help us?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.	Who told you?
Who told you?	People I know. They said you're an important man.
And suppose they take the table away?	What d'you mean, take the table away?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.	What did you pay him?
I can look after myself!	They were taking you away.

You sell anything?	Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.	That's better than yesterday.

A good place for what?  He's insane!	Just shut up.
Mama, that was a great dinner.	It certainly was.
They bombed us, we're off the air.	Warsaw's not the only radio station.

You know what? You treat me like dirt!	I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
You're a dirty pig!	Takes one to know one! Pig!

Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?	She fell down.
She fell down.	Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?

Better get home before it is.	Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
And he still wants to marry me!	He's a brave man.

How's your brother?	He's all right.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.	Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.	It's a promise?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.	Yes, she would.
What would your mother say to that?	This is my wedding.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?	If you think it'll be all right.
He'll still be your son-in-law!	You see how much we have to say.
You see how much we have to say.	Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
It's been the same one for three months.	Forgive me.  How are you?
You can take that out to the car.	Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Do you mind if I come down and see it?	Not at all.
Not at all.	I'm very interested in that body.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!	know.  But I saw him -
Not a thing.	Was there much blood?
What're you doing here?	I'll take care of him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.	Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Just rolled them up and threw them in.	Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.	This is enough for me.
Well, what'd you think?	I think we're on the right track.
I think we're on the right track.	Who're you calling?
He's holding out on you.	Let's go and see.  Taxi!
So would I.	It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Who's is it?	I'll have to try to remember.
Not without a warrant.	So you say -  Go on, Bob.
I never saw him before.	What's he want of you?
What's he want of you?	Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.	What's that to you?
What'd he think it was to you?	Ask him.  I don't know.
Ask him.  I don't know.	I'm asking you.
I'm asking you.	Keep on asking.
Yes.  I might not have been shot.	We were looking for this bird.
I said he hadn't written me.	Oh, then you did hear from him?
Did you go?	Yes.  But he didn't show up.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.	Seen any signs of it, Bill?
I think we may as well sit down.	I guess all the suspects are here.
Good morning --	Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
You don't think I had anything to do with it?	Where were you?
Want to take a poke at him?	I didn't mean you, Mister.
I thought you said you weren't going there.	Why, you said...
What are you going to do?	Just what I said I'd do.
Just what I said I'd do.	You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!	Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.	Chris -- Chris -- !
I'll get some.	You've said that for weeks.
All right.  All right.	I couldn't go near that woman.
I couldn't go near that woman.	I said all right!
You're going to return every cent of it!	I can't! I haven't got it!
I can't! I haven't got it!	What did you do with the rest?
What did you do with the rest?	I never had it.
We're just having a little drink.	So I see.
I got word from Wynant this morning...	So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.	That's all right.
Thanks, and goodbye.	What'll I do if something comes up?
Did you get my money?	I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.	I'm not telling anyone.
I'm not telling anyone.	But suppose some business comes up...
But suppose some business comes up...	That's just why I'm going.
I have no right to answer that.	What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
How are you?	I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.	That's all right.
I haven't been a detective for four years.	You don't say --
I see.  I see.	What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
How are you?	Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?	I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
I tell you -- he didn't do it.	They'll want more than your word for that.
Well, don't you?	You're always teasing.
Why do you say that?	Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
I've never heard about you.	I didn't knock Julia off.
I didn't knock Julia off.	All right - you didn't.
Is that true?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Why are you saying it?
Why are you saying it?	It's the only way it makes sense.
It's the only way it makes sense.	I hope you're well.
I wish you'd tell me who.	I wish you'd tell me.
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.	Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I'm going to tell her.	Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Got a nice evening dress?	Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?	Got a nice evening dress?
Got a nice evening dress?	I've got a lulu -- why?
The suspects!  They won't come.	Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations.	Who do you think did it?
How long has he been dead?	Couple of months anyway.
Couple of months anyway.	Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?	No.  Nobody but you.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.	I did find him!
I did find him!	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	He was down in the shop.
It was his body that was buried there.	Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.	That's a fact.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?	But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Looks like a hold-up!	What are you going to do?
Nick - I won't have you going down there.	Say you're the one who got me in this!
You wouldn't be a widow long.	You bet I wouldn't.
You bet I wouldn't.	Not with all your money!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?	Sure I will.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.	He's just been for a walk.
He's just been for a walk.	We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Maybe I will.	But Wynant --- ?
But Wynant --- ?	I don't believe he did it.
I don't believe he did it.	Why don't you?
So am I.	Come on, Watson, we're going places.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!	It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.	Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
Let's see.  Where's it from?	Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?	I don't know.
Your guess is as good as mine.	Oh take it!  Please take it!
Aren't you hot in that?	I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.	Is that another Christmas present?
I never saw that before.	No.  It's a Christmas present.
No.  It's a Christmas present.	Who gave it to you?
It's all right.  It just grazed me.	Someone get a doctor.
Someone get a doctor.	There's one coming.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.	I'll get some towels.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.	There's nothing I can do to help her.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.	They were kidding you.
They were kidding you.	I'd like to see you work.
I'd like to see you work.	Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
She didn't tell me a thing.	Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Isn't that my drink?	What are you drinking?
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.	We need ice.
What hit me?	That last Martini.
If you like 'em like that.	You got types?
You got types?	Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.	Who is she?
By the way, how is your father's side?	Much better, thanks.
Much better, thanks.	How many drinks have you had?
You might have mentioned me first.	He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.	I had him out this morning.
No, Mr. Charles.	How did you get in here?
Nick Charles here?	Yes.  Nick!
Yes.  Nick!	You his wife?
I know I left them there.	Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.	Maybe she has.
I'm sorry...  but...	Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.	I just wanted to tell you...
What's in the other direction?	This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.	Turn the car around.
Just keep quiet.	I have to answer him.
I have to answer him.	So you can give us away?
So you can give us away?	If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
I'm the one's got the big stick.	Suppose I don't go for that?
I've got no stomach for murder.	It's a combat action.
It's a combat action.	It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.	Then step aside.
You're out of your mind.	He's an enemy soldier.
He's an enemy soldier.	I'm not going to let you kill him.
I'm not going to let you kill him.	We're at war.
You don't know that.	You don't know he isn't.
You're the one with all the ideas.	You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
What about the gold?	What about it?
What about it?	Maybe we should split it up now.
And they can't fly around out there forever.	So we wait.
What do you figure it to be?	Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.	Let me see the map.
All right.  Let's get out of here.	The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.	He's not so--
What are you doing.	Low on gas.  Got to refill.
What are we going to do!?	We're going to keep driving.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.	No, please, not again.
What's it say?	Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
He's not slowing.	He's going to slow down.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.	He'll slow down.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.	Thought you were going to buy a car.
Why do I have to lie in the road?	Somebody has to.
Which way do we go!?	We go this way.
What do you make of them?	Shi'ites, I think.
Shi'ites, I think.	Is that good, or bad?
Is that good, or bad?	I don't know.  They killed Wes.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.	Why haven't they killed us!?
Why haven't they killed us!?	I don't know!
I don't know!	...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.	With what?  Against how many?
With what?  Against how many?	We can't just sit here waiting to die.
We can't just sit here waiting to die.	You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Slip out your M-16.	And then what?
And then what?	And then shoot them.
And then shoot them.	I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
Well, we should identify ourselves.	Yeah, I guess we should.
Just let me rest for a second.	We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
I pick that way.	Okay.  Then we go this way.
Wonder how the war's going?	It's got to be going better than this..
I don't want to die.	Makes two of us.
You still got a map on you?	What?  Yeah.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.	Is it all right if I stand up?
First Wes, now you?	I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.	And you; you've got it all together.
We can't just leave him.	Wes is dead!
Wes is dead!	What if he's not?
We should head Northeast.	Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
It's just a mongoose.	Is it dead?
Is it dead?	Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
What are you doing?	What does it look like I'm doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?	It looks like you're not doing anything.
A whole lot of nothing.	So where do we start?
We're not going to do anything.	They're going to kill us!
They're going to kill us!	They can't shoot us in here.
Where the hell is it!?	Just stay down.
X marks the spot.	Something like that.
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.	What are they doing here?
I don't hear any--	Shut up and listen!
This.  Whatever it is.	It's the treasure, that's what it is.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.	Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
Where you going?	Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.	Why you got to move away to talk!?
Why you got to move away to talk!?	We're going to be right over here.
Oh, God!  Oh God!	Just be cool.
Just be cool.	It's a mine, isn't it?
You didn't step on any mine.	I heard it click.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.	Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
What do we do with the Humvee?	We leave it.
They're not going to--	It's the only way.  We drive!
Take the binoculars.	Wh-what do you think--
Wh-what do you think--	TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.	You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
What!?  What!?	I did it!  I got the box open.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.	There might be something in there.
There might be something in there.	Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.	There might be.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.	No you're not.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.	What are you doing?

I like you, Baron.	I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
The pepper, too?	No, thank you.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?	I would like to.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.	I don't believe it!
I don't believe it!	Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
You look beautiful.	Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Adolph J. Giron.	And you expect me to believe that?
And you expect me to believe that?	Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it.

I know all your tricks.	And you're going to fall for them.
And you're going to fall for them.	So you think you can get me?
So you think you can get me?	Any minute I want!
Then a little nap--	How do you like my dress?
I'll be delighted.	And so will M'sieu Giron.
Then I mislay my checkbook--	Then you use the wrong lipstick--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--	And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?	The same thing.
This used to be my secretary's room.	I see.  She must have been very happy here.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.	Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.	Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame--
Make it out to cash!	As you like.
Do you know my first name?	No. What is it? Tell me.

Oh! You didn't read it!	Naturally I did.

Too much blue in crimson.	That's what you need!
What shade of powder do you use?	Peaches and cream.
Peaches and cream.	That's too dark.
That's too dark.	Do you realize I have light eyes?
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?	The pleasure is mine, madame.
I know that niche.	And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.	No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...	Yes, Madame Colet?

Two lumps, madame?	Please!  Thank you.
Yes, my bag!	Didn't you take it with you?

You should have more self-control. You were in the army.	Well, he was in the navy.
How much time?	An hour, two at most.
Good luck to you, Rose.	And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.	Thank you, Rose.
Who's the best? Say it.	You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Don't you mean work me?	Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
I make my own luck.	So do I.
None of the stewards have seen her.	This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.	It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
You're precious to me, Rose.	Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Is this in any way unclear?	What do I tell your mother?
What do I tell your mother?	Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.	I was tired.
I was tired.	Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
My God... Cal. Is it a --	Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
You're a good liar.	Almost as good as you.
This should be amusing.	Can I bum a cigarette?
Sure. Count me in.	Good. Settled then.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!	Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.	Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Cor... look at that, would ya.	They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Why have we stopped?	We've struck ice.
We've struck ice.	Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?	No, but we're making excellent time.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.	It's so cold.
It's so cold.	I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
I'm not going without you.	Get in the boat, Rose.
Will this work?	We'll find out.
You have to go for help.	I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.	I'll wait here.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?	I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.	I know, I know.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!	He couldn't have.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.	Now it's worse.
Now it's worse.	Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Looks okay. I don't see anything.	Could it have damaged the ship?
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.	This is crazy.
Are you nervous?	Au contraire, mon cher.
Where to, Miss?	To the stars.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.	Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?	Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
Fabrizio said you might be up --	Sssshh. Come here.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.	You're right. Only you can do that.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.	I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
I don't know the steps.	Just move with me. Don't think.
May I cut in, miss?	You're still my best girl, Cora.
Jack, must you go?	Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.	She had beautiful hands.
No, no! Just with her hands.	You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.	I see you.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!	Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.	Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
So don't marry him.	If only it were that simple.
If only it were that simple.	It is that simple.
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.	Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.	That penguin last night, is he one of them?
That penguin last night, is he one of them?	Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.	Is he your boyfriend?
Is he your boyfriend?	Worse I'm afraid.
So, you got a name by the way?	Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Could I speak to you in private?	Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
I'm Jack Dawson.	Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.	You think she was really there?
You think she was really there?	Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
Don't come any closer.	You had it the entire time?!
It's been 84 years...	Just tell us what you can --
Would you like anything?	I should like to see my drawing.
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.	Charmed, I'm sure.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--	Oh--a hundred times--
Oh--a hundred times--	--and I can tell you where to get off.
I can explain--	Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
Well--shall we go into dinner?	I'll join you later.
Hope we're not intruding.	This is Miss Marsh.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?	Do you want the truth, Anya?
Do you want the truth, Anya?	It would be a nice change from you.
It would be a nice change from you.	I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Isn't she lovely?	Yes--and <U>very</U> popular--
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.	We'll save you a place at our table.
I hope so.	That's a date.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?	Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
I don't understand.	I think you do.
Did you find it?	No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Where'd you get it?	Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.	What did you want a gun for?
What did you want a gun for?	Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.	Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?	Guess again, copper.
Could I see you a minute?	Sure!  Excuse me.
How about a little game later?	Fine--I'll be glad to.
You're coming back--	That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three.	I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Well, I'll be--!!!	What's the matter?
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.	Make it five.
Make it five.	Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.

You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!	I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.	Come on--let's take a swim.
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.	Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?	Lose?--I won a little--
I could see you were pining away--	Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Good night, Mrs. Brett!	Good night, idiot!
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?	I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.	You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Yes--is it all right if I come like this?	This time I'm really glad you showed up.
You mean that?	Don't let's talk about it.
Don't let's talk about it.	You said it! How about a little action?
What are you thinking?	A lot of things I'd like to forget.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.	I'll be there--Good-by.
Don't be a c-a-t.	You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Well, I can't.	Don't rub it in.
Don't rub it in.	But I'll have cocktails with you.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.	Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--	--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.	You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!	Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
This is Mr.--er--	Brett is the name.
Brett is the name.	Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
You're not very ambitious, are you?	Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.	You work too fast for me, young man.
Never eat before the show.	Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?	So you washed it off!
So you washed it off!	How about giving me another coat?
There's soft music--	--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.	Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
You've got lipstick all over you.	I could stand some more--
I thought you were one of my friends.	I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
I'm so sorry!	Want to take it back?
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?	Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Where did you hide it?	On the drunk.
Say--wait a minute!	See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
About sixteen hundred.	Partners, ain't we?
Thank you, sir.	I'll take one.
Are you screwy?	I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Shortie!--you know my motto?	Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--	--there's thousands of 'em!
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.	How're the tips?
How're the tips?	A dollar forty.
A dollar forty.	I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.	Not a chance.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.	Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Nix, the law!	Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?	I thought you were a smart guy.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?	We coulda got two third-class!

It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.	Didn't you know he made things?

I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.	I can't do that.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.	I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
How much do I pay him?	I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Helena, I'm so sorry --	Arnie, thank God.
Carl, that's insane.	So my wife is lying?
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.	Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --

You can't make me.	Oh, yes I can.
Okay, young lady, that's it.	Like I give a fuck.
Will we get invited to the White House?	I don't know.

I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.	She knows Arnie Metzger.
She knows Arnie Metzger.	So does half of San Diego.
So does half of San Diego.	You want to make a wager on this?
That's a big word for a fisherman.	Who do you work for?
I feel good.	No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?

I'm curious how you did this with such economy.	Everybody has a weakness.
Does this offer include my partner?	Only if he can be trusted.
Only if he can be trusted.	He'll do what I say.
If I can.	I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.	What is it you want me to do?
What is it you want me to do?	A small thing.  Nothing really.
What is the name of your informant?	It was an anonymous tip.

He has his doubts...	You doubt me?
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.	We sought only your infinite wisdom.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.	And how did you breach the Barrier?
And how did you breach the Barrier?	With a starship!
With a starship!	This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?	It could. Yes.
It could. Yes.	Then I shall make use of this starship.

No, but you can bet they will.	Understood. Kirk out.
Can we have it quiet?	Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Where did you get this power?	The power was within you.
Join my quest.	What is it you seek?
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.	Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
Your pain runs deep.	What do you know of my pain?
What do you know of my pain?	Let us explore it together.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.	If we could send a distress signal...
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.	Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.	Put it on the screen.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.	Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Why didn't you beep my communicator?	ER... You forgot to take it with you.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.	Not possible. You were never alone.
What is this?	I believe we are witnessing my birth.
It would appear we are too heavy.	It must be all those marsh melons.
I am here, Captain.	That's a little vague, Spock -
Is it possible?	Is what possible?
There's got to be a way out of this place.	This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.	How do you know?
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.	There, you see? See?
There, you see? See?	I have a half brother.
I have a half brother.	I gotta sit down.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.	I ordered you to defend this ship.
I ordered you to defend this ship.	You ordered me to kill my brother.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!	Captain, what have I done -
You must allow us to act.	Let me do something.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.	To land any closer would risk detection.
To land any closer would risk detection.	Mr. Sulu. Execute.
I do not often think of the past.	Who is it he reminds you of?
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?	I cannot be certain.
I cannot be certain.	But he does seem familiar?
But he does seem familiar?	He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.	Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Life is not a dream.	Go to sleep, Spock.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?	I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
"""Pack Up Your Troubles."""	Are we leaving, Captain?
What are you doing?	I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
I don't understand.	I've always known... I'll die alone.
And that is?	Because it's there.
What have I done?	Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
About the ship...	The ship needs its Captain.
The ship needs its Captain.	No special conditions?
What makes you think I won't turn us around?	Because you, too, must know.
You are mad!	Am I? We'll see.
No... I didn't.	Now learn something about yourself.
Now learn something about yourself.	No. I refuse.
We must change our course at once.	I'll take you to the bridge.
Who are you?	James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.

I belong here.	I don't understand...
Each man's pain is unique.	I hide no pain.
I hide no pain.	I know you better than that.
No. I will not.	You know I'm right.
Sybok, you must surrender.	No. You must kill me.
I don't get it.	You haven't told him?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.	I'm certainly not.

Yeah, yeah -- that's great.	How 'bout yourself?
How 'bout yourself?	Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
So...how's the world of serious science?	Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
We have to talk.	Good luck. You can't even think in here.

But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.	You're still a little... disoriented.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.	And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
It's important to observe everything.	I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...	A Carpet Cleaning Company?
You want me to rob him?	I...I...We need cash, James.
What does this mean to you?	...I had a dream about...something like that.
I thought I was in...prison again.	Just like that?  You were in prison?
It was?  I didn't...know.	James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
I don't understand what we're doing.	We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
Give me the gun.	The gun! ... I lost it
You smell so good.	You have to give yourself up, you know.
We need gas.	I thought you didn't know how to drive.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!	James, why don't we...?
James, why don't we...?	Lock it now!
You didn't have a gun before, did you?	I've got one now.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!	I did him a favor.  Now come on.
Are you hurt?	Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
They're keeping an eye on me.	Who's keeping an eye on you?
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.	Clues?  What kind of clues?
It's just a shot to calm you.	No more drugs.  Please...
No more drugs.  Please...	I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.	Perhaps it was a wrong number...
I need to go.	Do you know why you're here, James.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.	You wouldn't understand.
I have to go.	A jail?  Prison?

That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.	You want to go in?  Examine him?
You want to go in?  Examine him?	Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
No, thank you.	I'll be right here...just in case.

Where'd you learn to do that?	From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.	A medicine man?

You came to take my wife from me?	I came to kill her.
It's the truth, Jake.	That's a thick change of heart.
You think that's a lot of money?	All I have in the world.
You didn't kill her?	The time wasn't right.
Came close this time and it scares you.	Drop it, Jake.

How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?	What are you talking about!
It's the truth, Jake.	That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
I came for Grace.	You came to take my wife from me?
"I guess this is what they call ""ironee""? Hunh?"	It's not what you think, Jake.
How much could you get?	Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.	I need thirteen.
I need thirteen.	That's a bit much.
I'm not rambling.	You're talking like a madman.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.	A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.	You meant it.
You meant it.	What makes you say that?
What can I do for you, lad?	I was hoping we could talk.
I was hoping we could talk.	Talk?  About what?
Talk?  About what?	About things.  About your wife.
About things.  About your wife.	Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?	About what you said this morning.
Would I what?	Would you kill her?
Wait a second--	Ah, I can smell it on you.
You've got to be--	Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.	I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.	That's a solid name.
That's a solid name.	I'm a solid man.
"""Bobby Cooper."" What brings you to Superior, Coop?"	An overheated car.
An overheated car.	Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?	Darrell's a moron.
You broke my nose!	It ain't broke.
A lot that means.	Grace, tell him.
Who the hell is this!?	Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?	I'm her husband.
What the hell are you talking about?	What's your name anyway?
Cause she's dead.	Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?	I've had time to get over it.
I've had time to get over it.	You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.	You're too quick for me.
Got any requests?	That country shit all sounds the same to me.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.	How about I pick one out for you?
I want my car.	You got the money?
You believe that?	You think bad, and bad is what you get.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.	That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.	Yeah, but it was shot.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.	Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.	I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
"""That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."""	What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Don't look like nothing.	Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.	Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?	'Cause Harlin used to own it.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.	But he's dead.
I call the sheriff.	No! No police.
Soda.  You got any soda?	Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.	Soda.  You know.
Bobby? Are you all right?	I busted my leg!
I busted my leg!	Can you make it back up?
Hope is a four-letter word.	But we all need that too. Hold him.
Time to go for a walk, Jake.	My mother died in this canyon.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.	You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
You know I thought you'd left me back there.	What are you talking about?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.	Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
I'm not sailing his boat.	But I thought --
Good thinking.  What's all this?	I'm not coming back.
The money's right here! Get the key!	No! You get it!
Grace ... Grace?	After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
I wanted to talk.	I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.	What about us?
What about us?	There is no us, remember?
There is no us, remember?	Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
I thought you couldn't get your car.	I could if I had Jake's money.
I could if I had Jake's money.	Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...	You don't have any money put away, do you?
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.	Is it pretty?
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...	Nothing I understand better than a mess.
You could leave him.	I don't know how.
I'm guessing no.	Yeah, I guess you're right.
How do you know he's still not here?	Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?	You know what I want.
You know what I want.	Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
I have an idea.	And what would that be?
I guess it must.	What do you do anyway?
Where'd you learn to do that?	From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.	A medicine man?
A medicine man?	Those are white words, not ours.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.	I didn't say it bothered me.
I didn't say it bothered me.	Did you like it; me watching you?
Where you coming from?	All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.	You've been around.
You've been around.	I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.	Where you headed?
What happens when you lose?	I pack up and go somewhere else.
Thank you, Bobby.	You're welcome, Grace.
You're welcome, Grace.	You're not from around here, are you?
I just drove in this morning.	Drove into Superior?  What for?
No, I've got it.	What happened to your hand?
You sure you can manage?	I got it.
I got it.	Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?	I like that about me, beautiful.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?	I'm just going to my car?
I'm just going to my car?	That's right on my way.
That's right on my way.	My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Do you have to call me that?	I don't know your real name.
I don't know your real name.	Maybe I don't want you to.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.	And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.	The ticket is 30.55.
Out of here.	But, in particular?
Help me, Grace, help...	Like you helped her, Jake?
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.	Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
What's the matter?	You didn't hear something?
You didn't hear something?	Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.	There's someone in the house.
What the hell you looking at, girl?	Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.	They look nice.
They look nice.	You haven't even looked at them once.
I want to stay.	I said come on!
I'll keep it in my office room.	What about Jeb?
What about Jeb?	I have a lock on the door.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.	What did I say?
Once again please?	My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.	How old is Jeb?
Wrap it up.	You've made a considerably wise decision.
What about the game?	It's finished. I won.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.	My turn. What's your favorite song?
My turn. What's your favorite song?	Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

I have to go now.	One last question.
Have you ever tried to develop it?	I don't know what you're asking?
I thought he was carrying something.	But not a knife?
Just give me a minute.	Is there a problem?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.	We've already begun.

What's he talking about?	In college. A car accident.
In college. A car accident.	Was it serious?
You've never been sick?	I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
He's kind of a miracle.	Yes he is.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.	It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.	He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.

Let's say for example -	This I had to see myself.
How are you, Keaton?	I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
The answer is no.	Mr. Soze will be most -

The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.	Who is he?
Get a grip. I didn't know.	You didn't know.
A little of both.	Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
We're on vacation.	I've got a ton of work and no good people.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.	Which is shit.
Which is shit.	No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.

There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.	Is he the one that killed Keaton?
Is he the one that killed Keaton?	No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.	I'11 be sure to mention that to him.

You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?	You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know a religious guy named John Paul?	You know Ruby is in Attica?

Nothing further, your Honor.	Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
I thought I would need it.	And why, please tell us, would you think that?
That's not my handwriting.	You've just said you signed it.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?	It's a crime.
I wouldn't do it.	You would not...?
I completely understand ...	We just ...
She getting good care over there?	Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...

Why? What's happened?	I had the dream. The dream came back again...
Don't leave me... stay with me...	All the time.
I'm here, I've got you...	I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...

Where's the camera?	It's a present from my parents.
Stop this, stop this.	Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.	You'd like me to kill them?
I'll come to you tonight.	No, the children sleep with me.
No, the children sleep with me.	Give them to Refugio.
Enedina and Paco ...	What about them?

Let me pass!	You must listen to me before you go.
You must listen to me before you go.	I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.

And this innocent child.	Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
Yes, it is.	Don't you ever see him?
What do you mean?	Nothing. I didn't say anything.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.	I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.	You see, even the voice.
Come down here, you scamp.	Who is she?
Who is she?	My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Was that difficult to get?	No. Mother Superior told me to come.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.	You'll think you're still at the convent.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.	It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.	What's the matter?
Leave me now. You can go to bed.	Yes, sir. Good night.

It's very good.	Thank you; but it's missing something.
Thank you; but it's missing something.	That doesn't matter; I like it.
How in hell does it wind up?	I think I'd better go tomorrow.
What are you thinking about?	That your cousin is more to your taste.
If you wake first, wake me up.	What are you going to do?
Why the bad temper?	It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
Me, rich? Come on!	There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...	If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
I don't know -- they've always been there.	That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.	Why did he kill himself?
I'll be ready.	Do you intend to stay here for some time?
Are they going to work here too?	Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
What are you doing here? Get out.	Leave him alone.
What do you know about me?	I know that you used to work with an architect.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?	It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?	Well... is it so urgent?
Miss Viridiana ...	Are you Jorge?
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.	What's he called?
It's for people!	Then let him go and he'll follow you.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.	And let him get run over by somebody else?
Are your parents alive?	Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!	Don't say that.
How are you today?	Things seem to be getting better.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?	They told me it isn't at the hospital.

Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?	You cannot leave ...
He came in through the cupboard.	You little liar! Get out of here!

Don't invent stories; go to bed.	A black bull came.
A black bull came.	A black bull!
What's going on, Moncho?	This louse is looking for trouble.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?	They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
Forgive me if I have offended you.	You are forgiven. Goodbye.
When you are, miss.	Good, then let's go!
She looks like a sick marrow!	Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
What about you, Manuel?	I'm only good at making people laugh.
Have I slept long?	Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
How do you feel?	I have a headache.
I have a headache.	That will soon pass. It's nothing.
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.	Ah! Pleased to meet you.

It's only two hours away.	I know that.
I know that.	I'll come back all the time.
I'll come back all the time.	Of course you will.
Of course you will.	I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Your friend saw them.	Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Isn't there something called group hysteria?	You think you influenced her?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?	I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
What's happening to me?	Well, that's what we're here for.
Try to communicate with her somehow.	You think that'll help?
What does she look like?	Pretty.  She's a blond.
Pretty.  She's a blond.	Do you have any idea who she is?
Do you have any idea who she is?	Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
I didn't want to come.	Then why did you?
Then why did you?	Because he was worried about me.
Who's idea was it?	Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
At the party.	Toward the end.  You remember?
How're you holding up?	Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.	I didn't kill my wife.
Well maybe your wife...	She isn't here.
She isn't here.	When...when will she be back?
When...when will she be back?	I don't know.
You must think I'm pathetic.	No.  No, I don't.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?	You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
And then you weren't there.	Right.  I'm sorry.
That's not...It's not like that.	I've never even met you.
Tell me.  Please.	That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
What?  What are you afraid of?	I can't, no, no, I can't...
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...	Who?  Your husband?
Who?  Your husband?	And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
Who are you?	It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--	You're the flower lady.
I've seen you.  From the window.	Is everything alright?
What was her major?	Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
They're calling me in to work.	I should be going anyway.
Why are you here?	I don't know.
You look a little old for a student.	I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.	You know where she is?
You know where she is?	No, I don't.
No, I don't.	Please leave me alone.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.	Do we have to?
She's making this up.	I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
He looked like one of the Monkees.	Anyway, Claire slept with him...
Anyway, Claire slept with him...	I didn't sleep with him.
I didn't sleep with him.	...just so she could cut them off.
...just so she could cut them off.	He was so pissed.
He was so pissed.	I came in from my room...
I came in from my room...	We were suite mates.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.	Did he say that?
Did he say that?	Jody he was lying.
I can't believe this is happening.	We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
What are you going to do?	I don't know.
I don't know.	If she was dangerous before--
If she was dangerous before--	She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
Oh God...you knew.	I was down in Adamant...
Okay.  Okay.	I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Does Norman know?	Jody, she's alive.
Are you okay?	I think so
I think so	I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Mef?  What's Mef?	It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.	Please.  That's all I need.
What is it?	Kambucha mushroom tea...
You're discussing me with your psychic?	She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.	Thanks, but I'm fine.
Thanks, but I'm fine.	So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
How you holding up?	Good.  I'm good.
Okay, I'm a little tender.	Well good.  So you're human.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.	Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
I'm cooking you dinner.	You don't have to do that.
Look for antiques...	Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
Do you know it?	Don't think so.
Don't think so.	Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
She can't be here without me.	How can you be sure?
She did it.	We don't know that for sure.
I tried to break it off!	You should have tried harder.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.	So you fucked a student?!
So you fucked a student?!	That's not what I'm sayi--
That's not what I'm sayi--	DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
I don't like this, this...	Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
What's the matter?	It's too rough.
I take it your not mad at me.	Wouldn't go that far.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.	It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
But I don't remember.	Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.	What's wrong with me?
You don't remember?	When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...	I felt you...looking through me...
I felt you...looking through me...	We walked all night...
We walked all night...	You told me that I was...
You know I am.	Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.	Really big bed.
Keep your voice down.	I will NOT.
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.	What are you...?  No.
How do you know this?	We had a seance.
How did you--	Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
This is the Feur thing?	Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
Are you lonely?	No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
I don't need a shrink.	Harvey says he's amazing.
There we go.	Well, that's a relief.
You're not at the center.	I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.	We're going to be fine.
What are you doing?	Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
When you do this, I swear...	...Don't get all...
...Don't get all...	...like it never even happened...
...like it never even happened...	Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
What am I looking at?	I didn't do that.
I didn't do that.	Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?	Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Get down!  He'll see.	What's going on, Claire?
Sorry.  You understand.	Did you call about the Feurs?
Well, that's nice.	"""...especially Spencer's Theorem..."""
"""...for my father."""	I'm so sorry.
Did you tell her?	What?  No.  No.
I think so.  Maybe.	You are so brilliant.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...	You know what that does to me.
What kind of whispering?	I don't know.  Just...whispering.
What do you mean?  Some noises where?	In the house.  I was scared.
In the house.  I was scared.	Did you call the police?
Unless you need me to come home...	No, no.  It's fine.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.	Is it gone?
That's not what I'm sug--	...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.	But what if something happens?
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.	I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...	Remember how we were?
Of him I think.	Did she say that?
Did she say that?	More or less.
It's okay if you're not.	I am, really.
I am, really.	It's just she's been the focus for a while.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.	Not the focus.
Not the focus.	You know what I mean.
If you have to work...	No, no.  I'm just about...  There.

It is from love.	To love, you must be able to feel.
To love, you must be able to feel.	If you knew how I yearn for that...

Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.	Doctor's orders- - -?
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.	He fools around with his patients too.

So she didn't mention anything more about it?	No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
You got everything you ever wanted.	Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!	No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
You're late, bro!	Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.	You'll never believe who's in there.
You'll never believe who's in there.	It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!	Take a whiff of heaven.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.	It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?	Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
What is it now?	Check it out!
Check this out.  Hurry!	I better go, Dad.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.	Not ever. Never.
...A bouncer? Are you serious?	Maybe he got promoted.
Who the hell was your father?	Well, Dad said...
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.	Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.	Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.	Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
That's crazy talk.	I defy any and all limits.
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...	You and your pep talks.
Never say never.	Oh, god.  Look. Look.
What gives, Don Corleone?	We reinvented ourselves.
We reinvented ourselves.	New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.	Jealousy is so unattractive.
You have changed since second grade.	I mean, what do you think?
Which you pulled, hard!	"That was code for ""I like you."""
Hi, Teddy Bear.	"Christy?  You want to be in ""Heaven?"""
"Christy?  You want to be in ""Heaven?"""	I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.	Yeah? You like?
Yeah? You like?	Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.	But that smile.
From your lips, to God's ears.	You go first.
You go first.	Ladies first.  I insist.
Ladies first.  I insist.	Well. The prom's coming up.
We miss you. We miss our son.	We miss our family.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.	We own a small family grocery store.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.	I will not have my boys arguing.
It's okay. You need me?	Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.	Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...	...not the pit.
You guys are my parents.	Of course we are.
Ted! Do something!	What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?	This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!	Hang in there, I'll think of something.
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.	Of course we were.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?	Whatever you want.
Who exactly ARE you?	What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.	And who IS Ted Nelson?
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?	Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.	Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.	Hi ho, Silver.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.	The one with the horses.
It's your car. These are all your cars.	Some of them have to be automatics.
You do know how to drive?	I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.	Want a lesson?
I-I don't have the keys.	They're in the ignition, silly.
You're on the next plane home.	I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?	Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
He was my Grandfather, too.	I meant biologically.
I meant biologically.	That's a crappy thing to say.
If you could just sign right there.	You want it in writing?
You want it in writing?	Just a formality.
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.	Most places are, Jimmy.
So, what brings you here at his hour?	My new bike.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.	It's not up to me.
Very ambitious. I like that.	The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
You're quick. I like that.	You think you're working with chimps here?
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.	I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.	Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
That's hard to believe.	But absolutely true.
Do you trust me, Julie?	Not a chance.
I'm trembling with excitement.	That has more to do with your proximity to me.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.	My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
That's refreshingly deviant.	What about you?
What about you?	I'm very aural.
I'm very aural.	Tell me more.
That's probably my office.	Well? Where the hell are you?
Well? Where the hell are you?	He's on the move?
He's on the move?	I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.	Let's do it.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.	He didn't. He had it built.
"Not ""whatever.""  It's two different things."	He cared enough to want you to have it.
He cared enough to want you to have it.	He phoned it in.
Your dad taught you everything.	I mean my father.
It's all so complicated.	It's incredibly simple.
Eventually you'll let go.	And then what?
And then what?	Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
Where are we going?	To the best hiding place in the world.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.	Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.	Why can't you be nice to me?
Why can't you be nice to me?	You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.	"Funny you should say ""peachy."""
"Funny you should say ""peachy."""	I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.	My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.	Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
She said peanuts, you cretin.	You never know around here.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?	Your article sucked.
Your article sucked.	In what sense?
I have absolutely no intention--	--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
But who would run the store?	Forget the store. Think big.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.	But how would we pay our bills?
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?	Only the best for my mother.
Only the best for my mother.	You promise you'll finish school?
You promise you'll finish school?	I'll make you very proud.
That's part of growing up, honey.	What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.	You called the cops on us?
You called the cops on us?	Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Rules are rules.	Come on, it's our only senior prom.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.	Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.	I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.	Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
I never figured you for a pimp.	"Have you ever even looked at ""Heaven?"""
What are you doing?	My job. Back off, Benedict.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.	You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.	I can't wait to see the pictures.
I can't wait to see the pictures.	It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
My father must've been amazing.	He was in a league of his own.
I told you you could do it.	I was like a different person tonight.
I was like a different person tonight.	You were the new and improved you.
You were the new and improved you.	I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
Really? You'd do that for me?	I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.	You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
Me? The King of Coitus?	The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.	Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...	Why, look who's here.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.	YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?	All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.	Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?	Yeah.  Everything's cool.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.	I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
You do like girls, don't you?	Of course I like girls.
Of course I like girls.	A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?	As much as possible.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.	I have only one concern...
People pay good money for that?	I'm just a messenger.
How you doing, Artie?	I... You know... I...
Talk to me Artie.	Kelly Van Ryan...
And where might that be?	I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.	I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.	I'd like that.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.	And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.	She still work there?
Take your time.	They were in me.  Both places... you know.
I don't know what to say...	You could tell me where you were last night.
Maybe she used another name.	Ray thinks she was murdered.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?	Suzie Toller is missing.
Will you do me one favor?	Ray, you heard him...
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.	We don't know that, Ray...
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.	Where's the body?
If you want company...	Just check out the car.
Guess I kind of lost it there.	You could say that.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?	I net a guy in a bar.
I've got that two o'clock in town.	Back to the land of grownups.
He did say something.	What was that?
What was that?	"He said, ""No little bitch can ever make me come."""
About a year ago.	He dropped Jimmy off first?
That bothers you?	Yeah, maybe, a little.
Yeah, maybe, a little.	Why is that?
I want a full-scale investigation.	You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.	I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?	Yeah... okay... he did
A ride.  You want one?	Yeah.  But I got my bike.
Thank you, Jimmy.	Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
It's those rocks, up there.	You and Suzie used to come out here together?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.	I think we just need to get wasted.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?	Oh, for Christ's sake.
Get off my property.	I'm not on your property!
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.	You're out of your mind.
Is there some reason why you're here?	Curiosity, I guess.
Curiosity, I guess.	About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.	Where, the mall?
Where, the mall?	A friend of mine bought a boat.
He... Sam Lombardo?	Yes.  God, Mom...
Kelly.  What is it?	I miss Dad.
I miss Dad.	Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...	No you don't.
I would hardly say you look like trash.	No thanks to you.
Okay, what's the matter?	You notice my new jumper?
"Which one of your ""bodyguards"" is that?"	Whichever one I want.
I'm running away.	You think that's wise?
You think that's wise?	Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.	That's not your line.
That's not your line.	Say you love me.
Say you love me.	I love you.  Now give me the line.
I love you.  Now give me the line.	No little girl can ever make me come.
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.	Duquette.  Forget him...
And you believe her?	I don't know.  I want to see you...
Do it to ourselves?	We have to stick with the plan.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?	So you got my mom's money.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...	Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.	In back of the garage.
Just like that?	Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
I just want my life back...	Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
It doesn't look like it.	Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.	I did.  At Blue Balls.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.	Sit down, Lombardo.
I had to go look for this coupon.	The one you bought at school.
Sandy... What's up?	Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Shit. Here we go again.	Didn't you see her this morning?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?	Can't.  Got a passenger.
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.	I'm sure we will.
What is this?  A whole new train?	Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
My God!  He's so excessive!	Where have you been?
Are those just button buttons or...?	Of course not.
It was in your book.	Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
What?  President Grant is...!	I know!  I know!
There's only seventy-eight.	Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
When we find him, he is mine.	Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.	Relax.  We're almost there.
It's not a guy...	It's a town!
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.	Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
Oh, damn!  That's it.	It's better than nothing.
This is good.	Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
Know what this is?	Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.	A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Can you fill me in here?	Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
They're so precious when they're asleep.	You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.	I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
So... what happened?	Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.	Uh... how long ago was this?
At least I tried something.	Hey, I tried the board.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!	It's a repeating steam cannon!
Now, what was that?	"You're either having a seizure or you just said ""hello."""
"You're either having a seizure or you just said ""hello."""	Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
That's a lot of butler.	Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.	Is this leading somewhere?
That should put us ahead of the criminals.	I'll work on it.
You need that real often?	Always hoping.  Or this...
But don't pull that again.	Wouldn't dream of it.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.	Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
He calls it the Tarantula.	But it only has six legs.
You didn't tell us you had this on!	My Lord, he was telling the truth!
I could get used to this, looking down on people.	They don't even realize they should be frightened.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.	Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
My.  It's gotten longer.	You bring the best out in a man.
You've... done... this... before.	I've had some practice.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.	Would that include me?
Would that include me?	Oh, I would hope not.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?	You tell me.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?	You most certainly do.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?	I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Good work.  Really.	This is Colonel Richards.
This is Colonel Richards.	Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.	How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
No, sir... just a businessman.	Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.	I deal with some tough customers.
This is something.	It's a smelting retort.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?	He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.	Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?	We'll explain on the way.
You're not going to use it, are you?	Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
When are they coming?	They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?	In an hour they're gone!
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?	Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
You're chasing a dream.	Just get me some horses.
You left me to die, friend.	You managed alright.
You managed alright.	Is this what's left of your army?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.	Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?	Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
They look like acorns.	Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.	You are very important, Willow.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.	My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.	Not today, Willow.
Not today, Willow.	It's a matter of great importance to me!
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.	I have no family.
Because it's true.	I don't believe you.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.	I'm not going to let this baby die.
I do what I'm told.	Too bad you're not more like your father.
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.	My step-father's going to tear you apart.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?	No.  I mean yes.
We're a tiny version of all that?	As above, so below.
Who is that girl, anyway?	Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
Then you get us out of here.	I will!  But I need help!
He's no magician.	He turned that monster into stone!
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.	Want me to carry Elora?
Want me to carry Elora?	I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
She's in love.	You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
She asked about you, Madmartigan.	Well what did she say?
Where's the baby??	I thought you had her!
Because she's sick.	Because she's sick.
Time to change her diaper.	Time to leave.
Hey!  Give me that baby!	These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?	I hate this.
What's that?  I hear something!	You hear trouble.
You hear trouble.	What is it?
Smells like a battle.	Are you a warrior?
Are you a warrior?	The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
You all right?	These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Thanks for your help, Peck.	Are you okay?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!	Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.	Good.  How long will it take?
Dada, what's a daikini?	Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.	Are you scared?
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!	She's too powerful, Raziel
I just wanted to test it first.	No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
Oooh, this smells terrible.	That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?	The art of transformation!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!	What's the magician's weapon?
What's the magician's weapon?	The limitless power of...
How am I gonna do that?	Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I'm all finished.  Now what?	Burn it to a fine ash.
You must learn magic.	That's all I ever wanted!
That's all I ever wanted!	Then I will teach you.
Who are you!  Who are you!	I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
Get back here, Rool!	Ouch!  Let go of me!
Are you sure?	Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.	He never misses.
Who is he?	I don't know much about him.
She needs to be changed.	I changed her already!
Talk!  Say something!	I can't see anything--she's too bright!
This is not going well.	Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?	Guess I'm not used to so much.
Guess I'm not used to so much.	Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
Cows. You know, cows?	I've seen pictures.
I've seen pictures.	Good, you start tomorrow.
Put my car in the garage and close the door.	John, I don't understand any of this.
Where's Timmy and Buck?	Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?	You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Everything is all right, John.	Pick up the hat.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.	It's been a while.
I came to see Rachel Lapp.	Try the house.
Have you got your gun on now?	Sure have, Sam.
Don't let them hurt you.	I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
What are you going to do?	I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
...I want to say a thing.	What's that, Sam?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.	You don't say.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?	No pistol. Ever.
He was... like him.	Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?	No... I saw the man who killed him.
I saw him.	Who'd you see?
It's all over, Paul.	Move! Or you die right here!
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.	Don't try me, Johnny!
What's your first move?	A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
How reliable is this kid?	Oh, he's good.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?	If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
I want you to take this... to remember by.	Where's my baggy pants?
Where's my baggy pants?	Here. Whenever you want them.
You're so sure of that?	Aren't you? After today?
That's your way, not mine.	That's God's way!
When will you be going?	Not long... A few days.
But... You may not be well enough.	I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
What else can you do?	I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.	Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?	We had some lemonade and he left.
We had some lemonade and he left.	A real fireball.
I'm going this morning.	But Stoltzfus said...
But Stoltzfus said...	I know what he said.
Something wrong with buttons?	Buttons are Hochmut.
Tell him his tea stinks.	You tell him. When you're able.
Does anybody know I'm here?	Only the elders.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?	No, no doctor...
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.	I was wrong.
But not a good tired.	What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
They kid a lot.	I would not be too sure.
You hear me?	I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.	That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
Anybody know about this?	I didn't even know about it.
I didn't even know about it.	Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
You admit you're lying?	I admit I don't know where he is.
I admit I don't know where he is.	You're the first one he'll contact.
You're the first one he'll contact.	He's got my number.
I don't know where he is.	But... if you had to guess?
What's so funny?	Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
Yes, thank you very much.	John said you're Amish.
I am not a child.	You are acting like one!
You are acting like one!	I will be the judge of that.
Who was that man?	His name is John Book.
Never seen anything like that in all my years.	He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.	You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?	Yes. Samuel! We're going.
He's not in this building.	All right, where is he?
What about Carter?	Tight. But I'm working on him.
Tight. But I'm working on him.	Lean on him.
She say where he is?	I don't think she knows.
Get back in there.	My son is out there!
My son is out there!	Nobody's going to hurt your son...
You might have killed him!	Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
I don't want to stay here.	They are English. They don't understand.
They are English. They don't understand.	I wish dawdie was with us.
I wish dawdie was with us.	I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Momma... are they angry with us.	No... No. It is just the English way.

I'd sooner wait outside.	But why?  Why?
But why?  Why?	Because I'm still scared!

Somebody pulled my tail.	Oh, you did it yourself!
Oh, you did it yourself!	I -- Oh --
I -- Oh --	Here --   Come on.
Here --   Come on.	What was that?
What if it were a brontosaurus?	I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.	Don't you start it, too!
No?  Now, wait a minute.	You don't neither --

I dont know what youre talking about!	I think you do.
What are you talking about?	Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
Surely you believe in living dangerously.	Not at that price. Time to surrender.

No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.	Yes you are.
They're practically on us . . .	That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
They're following us.	All right.  Mission accomplished.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.	What are you up to?
What are you up to?	Don't look.  Turn around.
. . . What?	Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
His . . . whatever.	I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
Damn straight!  We were heroes.	Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Coward.  Giving up.	SHUT UP, Rorschach.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.	What do you mean, frame-up?
What do you mean, frame-up?	Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.	Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --	We should get back --  What?
We should get back --  What?	Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Did you know he was back on the streets?	I did not.  Now get out of my way!
I did not.  Now get out of my way!	Isn't it true that you --
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.	No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.	Am I free to go?
I'm terribly sorry.	What does this mean?  What does it --
Their real names, please.	I don't know their real names.
I don't know their real names.	You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.	I don't know their real names!
Maybe I'll do that.	I'm sorry about Blake.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --	I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.	And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --	Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.	You're making a big --
Yes it does.	Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
We're not after car thieves here.	What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Is that all?	Just remember, I'll be watching.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.	Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Who the hell are you?	The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?	What is this place?
What is this place?	Looks like a diner.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.	You what? A wire transfer of this size?
You what? A wire transfer of this size?	If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.	You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...	The scum of the Earth.
The scum of the Earth.	But programmable. And expendable.
But programmable. And expendable.	I've seen enough. Turn it off.
Whatchu doing here?	Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.	What weapons do you have?
What are you doing?	It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.	It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
He's shut out the communication circuit!	You can't talk to it?
A piece of shrapnel hit me.	I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
Where'd the damn truck go?!	Go to the water, it's that way!
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.	We'll have to go after them.
We'll have to go after them.	Aren't you afraid?
Where are we going?	We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.	Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Are you alright?	What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
They tell me you're an American agent.	What are you talking about?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.	I'm from L.A.
Who are you?	We hung out last night, remember?
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.	That right? Why's that?
Yorgi asked me to.	You do everything Yorgi says?
You do everything Yorgi says?	Go to hell.
The Peace conference...	Nice place to start, don't you think?
What was that for?	I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
What are you doing?	It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
Nothing. He had two days.	Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
This is your standard dart gun.	That one I'm real familiar with.
I'm through, Xander.	I can see that. Why?
I'll leave you two alone to talk.	Yeah, thanks a lot.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?	Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
Help me with this guy.	It's like you said, every man for himself.
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?	He's a pretty good actor, though.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?	A parachute. This does not argue well.
What's so damn funny?	Been to any good diners lately?
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!	"What's ""Anarchy 99""?"
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.	It'll work faster if I have an account number.
That's the guy.	This pizda? Never seen him before.
I wish I could go.	We all do.
Jean... can you?	I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.	I'll tell you one thing though.
What's wrong with him?	His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Scott.. I -	I don't like him being here.
I don't like him being here.	What are you talking about?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.	Sure you are, sport.
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?	I wanted to talk to you.
Logan, do you see this ring?	I've seen a lot of rings.
I've seen a lot of rings.	Yeah, I'll bet you have.
He takes his work seriously.	He takes himself seriously.
Were you now?	What do you say?
You should always work with a spotter.	He's busy right now.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.	By reading my thoughts?
Anything else I can get you?	Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.	There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.	I won't light the cigars - how about that?
What is it you intend to do to me?	Let's just say, God works too slowly.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?	Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.	You mutant bastards...
Where am I?	You're backstage at the encore of creation.
I do love a good check mate.	What do you want?
What do you want?	Come with me and I'll let her live.
You designed this yourself?	Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.	He helped you?
Where are we going?	To find Rogue.
I felt like she almost killed me.	If she held on any longer she could have.
If she held on any longer she could have.	And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
Is that what you're looking for?	A piece.  Only a piece.
A piece.  Only a piece.	Is it enough?
Is it enough?	Enough for a test.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.	And I'll never understand terrorists.

No, sir.  It will never happen again.	Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Where did you get this cauliflower?	From your office, sir.
From your office, sir.	Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Is it that music?	MMMMM!  MMMMM!
MMMMM!  MMMMM!	Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
That's a tough choice.	Is it worth taking a chance?
Is it worth taking a chance?	I suppose you're right.
Are you suggesting I call him master???	No, of course not.  I just meant...
No, of course not.  I just meant...	All right then!
What a strange fellow.	Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.

Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.	Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
I hope you like large weddings.	Whatever makes you happy.
Does that mean you love me?	You bet your boots it does.
And your passport?	Yes, don't worry.
Yes, don't worry.	Call me from New York before you leave??
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.	Oh, darling -- so will I.
Well... we'll see.	Will there be anything else?

Come on, big fellow!	Is everything ready?
That sound good, boss.	... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
There's only one way.	I'll bet it's a doozy.
I'm a failure.	Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
Thanks...for all your help.	That's what we're paid for.
